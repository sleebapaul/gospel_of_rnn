    "Steps\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the raw gospel data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use American Standard Version of Gospel Of Matthew\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Tokenize each sentence to words and special characters using an efficient word tokenizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) for tokenizing sentence. Spacy model used is `en_core_web_md`. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add tokens to structure the trainable data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - <SOV\\> : Start of a verse\n",
    "    - <EOV\\> : End of a verse\n",
    "    - <SOC\\> : Start of a chapter\n",
    "    - <EOC\\> : End of a chapter\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Save training data to a file. \n",
