1 And the day also when he was in Jerusalem , the Galilaeans were cleansed , and his disciples were with him ; 
2 And he said to them , Go into the next towns , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him . 
3 And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the master of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guest - chamber , where I may eat the passover with my disciples ? 
4 And he will show you a large upper room furnished : there make ready . 
5 And they went and found as he had said to them : and they made ready the passover . 
6 And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him . 
7 And he said to them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer . 
8 For I say unto you , that I will not eat any more at all of it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . 
9 And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves . 
10 For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come . 
11 And he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me . 
12 In like manner also the cup after , they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , for these mighty works ? 
13 And he said , Yea , rather be the kingdom of God . And all the people came unto him , and he was teaching them . 
14 And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him . 
15 And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ? 
16 And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away . 
17 And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept . 
18 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female . 
19 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ; 
20 And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more two , but one flesh . 
21 What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . 
22 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter . 
23 And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her : 
24 and if she herself shall put away her husband , and marry another , she committeth adultery . 
25 And they were bringing unto him little children , that he should touch them : and the disciples rebuked them . 
26 But when Jesus saw it , he was moved with indignation , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me ; forbid them not : for to such belongeth the kingdom of God . 
27 Verily I say to you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , shall in no wise enter into it . 
28 And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? 
29 And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is God . 
30 Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honor thy father and mother . 
31 And he answered and said unto him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth . 
32 And Jesus looking upon him loved him , and said unto him , One thing lackest thou : go , sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . 
33 But when he heard these things , he became exceeding sorrowful ; for he was very rich . 
34 And Jesus seeing him said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! 
35 For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . 
36 And they that heard it said , Then who can be saved ? 
37 But he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God . 
38 And Peter said , Lo , we have left our own , and followed thee . 
39 And he said to them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or wife , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake , 
40 who shall not receive manifold more in this time , and in the world to come eternal life . 
41 And he took to him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man . 
42 For he shall be delivered up to the nations , and shall be mocked , and insulted , and spit upon ; 
43 and they shall scourge and kill him : and the third day he shall rise again . 
44 And they understood none of these things ; and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken . 
45 And it came to pass , as they went in the way , a certain man said to him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . 
46 And Jesus said to him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven ' have ' nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . 
47 And another of the disciples said to him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . 
48 But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead . 
49 And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him . 
50 And behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep . 
51 And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Save , Lord ; we perish . 
52 And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm . 
53 But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ? 
54 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with demons , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man could pass by that way . 
55 And behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ? 
56 And there was also a superscription over him , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . 
57 And one of the malefactors , who were hanged , railed on him , saying , If thou art Christ , save thyself and us . 
58 But the other answering , rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?

1 And this report was to him that the multitude were assembled to be ' blind ' . 
2 Now at the feast the governor was wo nt to release unto the multitude a prisoner , whom they would . 
3 And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas . 
4 Therefore when they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? 
5 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up . 
6 And while he was sitting on the judgment - seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him . 
7 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus . 
8 But the governor answered and said unto them , Which of the two will ye that I release unto you ? And they said , Barabbas . 
9 Pilate saith unto them , What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? They all say unto him , Let be crucified . 
10 And the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more urgently , Crucify him . 
11 And Pilate , desirous of contenting the crowd , released to them Barabbas , and delivered up Jesus , when he had scourged him , that he might be crucified . 
12 And the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band ; 
13 And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head , 
14 And began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews ! 
15 And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him . 
16 And when they had mocked him , they took off from him the robe , and put on him his garments , and led him away to crucify him . 
17 And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to go [ with them ] that he might bear his cross . 
18 And having come to a place called Golgotha , which means Place of a skull , 
19 they gave to him to drink vinegar mingled with gall ; and having tasted it , he would not drink . 
20 And having crucified him , they parted his clothes amongst [ themselves ] , casting lots . 
21 And sitting down , they kept guard over him there . 
22 And they set up over his head his accusation written : This is Jesus , the King of the Jews . 
23 Then crucified with him are two robbers , one on the right hand , and one on the left . 
24 And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ha ! Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , 
25 save thyself , and come down from the cross . 
26 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes , He saved others ; himself he can not save . 
27 Let Christ the king of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him reproached him . 
28 And when he was come into the house , Jesus anticipated him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? the kings of the earth , from whom do they receive toll or tribute ? from their sons , or from strangers ? 
29 And when he said , From strangers , Jesus said to him , Then the sons are free . 
30 And , lest it cause to receive a flesh , we will not sit down , and take them away : there is no one who shall do a great work in my name , and be able to speak evil of me : 
31 for he who is not against us is for us . 
32 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink , because ye are Christ 's , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward . 
33 And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea . 
34 Woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes ! 
35 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell . 
36 And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell . 
37 And if thy right hand be a snare to thee , cut it off and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell . 
38 And if thy right hand offend thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell . 
39 It has been said too , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement : 
40 but I say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , except for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery . 
41 The disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry . 
42 But he said unto them , All can not receive this word , but those to whom it has been given ; 
43 for there are eunuchs who from the mother 's womb are born of the old and that hath been born of the Spirit , from the earliest part of the earth to the uttermost part of the heavens , 
44 And from the days of our fathers to Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of the heavens , 
45 but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . 
46 And Jesus said to the centurion , Go thy way ; as thou hast believed , ' so ' be it done unto thee . And the servant was healed in that hour . 
47 And when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying sick of a fever . 
48 And he touched her hand , and the fever left her ; and she arose , and ministered unto him . 
49 And when even was come , they brought unto him many possessed with demons : and he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all that were sick : 
50 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities , and bare our diseases . 
51 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandments to depart unto the other side . 
52 And a certain scribe came , and said unto him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . 
53 And Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven ' have ' nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . 
54 And another of the disciples said to him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . 
55 But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead . 
56 And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him . 
57 And behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep . 
58 And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Save , Lord ; we perish .

1 And when Jesus had come into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ? 
2 And they said , Some say that thou art John the Baptist : some , Elias ; and others , Jeremias , or one of the prophets . 
3 He saith unto them , But who say ye that I am ? 
4 And Simon Peter answered and said , Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . 
5 And Jesus answered and said unto him , Blessed art thou , Simon Bar - Jona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven . 
6 And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it . 
7 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens ; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens . 
8 And he that was healed , went up straightway from the water , and lo , the heavens were opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him : 
9 and lo , a voice out of the heavens saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him . 
10 And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid . 
11 And Jesus came and touched them and said , Arise , and be not afraid . 
12 And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , save Jesus only . 
13 And as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen from the dead . 
14 And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come ? 
15 And Jesus answered and said to them , Elias truly shall first come , and restore all things . 
16 But I say unto you , that Elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them . 
17 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist . 
18 And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying , 
19 Lord , have mercy on my son : for he is epileptic , and suffereth sorely ; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water . 
20 And I brought him to thy disciples , and they were not able to heal him . 
21 And Jesus answering said , O unbelieving and perverted generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring hither thy son . 
22 But as he was yet coming , the demon tore him and dragged him all together . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and gave him back to his father . 
23 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they were all wondering at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples , 
24 Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men . 
25 But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it . And they feared to ask him concerning this saying . 
26 And a reasoning came in amongst them , who should be the greatest of the world . 
27 And when he had completed all , there arose a mighty famine in that country ; and he began to be in want . 
28 And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine . 
29 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him . 
30 And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have abundance of bread , and * I * perish here by famine . 
31 I will rise up and go to my father , and will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee , 
32 and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants . 
33 And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him . 
34 And the son said to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight : I am no more worthy to be called thy son . 
35 But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet ; 
36 and bring the fatted calf , ' and ' kill it , and let us eat and make merry : 
37 for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry . 
38 And his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing . 
39 And he called one of the servants , and inquired what these things might be . 
40 And he said to him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound . 
41 But he was angry , and would not go in : and his father came out , and entreated him . 
42 But he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , and I never transgressed a commandment of thine ; and ' yet ' thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends : 
43 but when this thy son , who has devoured thy substance with harlots , is come , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf . 
44 But he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me : and all that I have is thine . 
45 It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .

1 And ye shall not believe if ye shall ask , the Father who is in heaven : 
2 and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . 
3 They answered him , We are Abraham 's seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ? 
4 Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin . 
5 And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever : the son abideth for ever . 
6 If therefore the Son shall set you free , ye shall be really free . 
7 I know that ye are Abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you . 
8 I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father . 
9 They answered and said to him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith to them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham . 
10 But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard from God : this did not Abraham . 
11 Ye do the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God . 
12 Jesus said to them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me . 
13 Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye can not hear my word . 
14 Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it . 
15 And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not . 
16 Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I speak the truth , why do ye not believe me ? 
17 He that is of God heareth the words of God : therefore ye have not known him , and have seen him . 
18 Philip saith unto him , Lord , show us the Father , and it sufficeth us . 
19 Jesus saith to him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how sayest thou then , Show us the Father ? 
20 Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not from myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works . 
21 Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake . 
22 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go to my Father . 
23 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son . 
24 If ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it . 
25 If ye love me , keep my commandments . 
26 And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ; 
27 Even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world can not receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and will be in you . 
28 I will not leave you comfortless ; I will come to you . 
29 Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also . 
30 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you . 
31 He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him . 
32 Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us , and not to the world ? 
33 Jesus answered and said to him , If a man love me , he will keep my word : and my Father will love him , and we will come to him , and make our abode with him . 
34 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's who sent me . 
35 These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you . 
36 But the Comforter , who is the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said to you . 
37 Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . 
38 Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you . If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go to the Father : for my Father is greater than I. 
39 And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he . 
40 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me . 
41 When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me . 
42 The disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake . 
43 Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom , one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved . 
44 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , to ask who it should be of whom he spoke . 
45 He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ? 
46 Jesus answered , He it is to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon . 
47 And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , That thou doest , do quickly . 
48 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him . 
49 For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said to him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor . 
50 He then having received the sop , went immediately out : and it was night . 
51 Therefore when he had gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him . 
52 If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall immediately glorify him . 
53 Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said to the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say unto you . 
54 A new commandment I give to you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . 
55 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another . 
56 Simon Peter said to him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterward . 
57 Peter said unto him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake . 
58 Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .

1 And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee , for he would not walk in Judea , because the Jews sought to kill him . 
2 Now the Jews ' feast of tabernacles was at hand . 
3 His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest ; 
4 for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be [ known ] in public . If thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world . 
5 For neither did his brethren believe in him . 
6 Then Jesus said to them , My time is not yet come : but your time is always ready . 
7 The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that its works are evil . 
8 Go ye up unto this feast : I go not yet to this feast , for my time is not yet full come . 
9 When he had said these words to them , he abode still in Galilee . 
10 But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up to the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret . 
11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ? 
12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , No ; but he deceives the crowd . 
13 Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews . 
14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught . 
15 And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? 
16 Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me . 
17 If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it is of God , or whether I speak from myself . 
18 He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him . 
19 Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ? 
20 The people answered and said , Thou hast a demon : who goeth about to kill thee ? 
21 Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all wonder . 
22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is from Moses , but from the fathers ) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man . 
23 If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath ? 
24 Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment . 
25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ? 
26 But lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing to him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ? 
27 But we know this man , whence he is : whereas when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is . 
28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not . 
29 But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me . 
30 Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come . 
31 And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ? 
32 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas : 
33 And they took counsel together that they might put him to death : for they feared the people . 
34 Afterward Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve . 
35 And he went away , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him to them . 
36 And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money . 
37 And he consented , and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude . 
38 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment , that , if any man knew where he was , he should show it , that they might take him .

1 But Jesus went about in the temple and taught , and there was a man there who had a withered hand . 
2 And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him . 
3 And he saith to the man who had the withered hand , Stand forth . 
4 And he said to them , Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? But they held their peace . 
5 And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other . 
6 And the Pharisees went forth , and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him . 
7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea . 
8 And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him . 
9 And he spoke to his disciples , that a small boat should wait on him because of the crowd , lest they should throng him . 
10 For he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him to touch him , as many as had plagues . 
11 And unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God . 
12 And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known . 
13 And he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him . 
14 And he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach , 
15 And to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out demons . 
16 And Simon he surnamed Peter ; 
17 And James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , Sons of thunder ; 
18 And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the ' son ' of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Cananaean , 
19 And Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him . And he cometh into a house . 
20 And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread . 
21 And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself . 
22 And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said , He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils . 
23 And he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ? 
24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand . 
25 And if a house be divided against itself , that house can not stand . 
26 And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he can not stand , but hath an end . 
27 No man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house . 
28 Verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men , and any blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme ; 
29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation . 
30 Because they said , He hath an unclean spirit . 
31 There came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him . 
32 And the multitude sat about him , and they said to him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee . 
33 And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother , or my brethren ? 
34 And he looked around on them that sat about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren ! 
35 For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother .

1 And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such authority unto men . 
2 And as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , called Matthew , sitting at the place of toll : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him . 
3 And it came to pass , as he sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples . 
4 And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Teacher with publicans and sinners ? 
5 But when Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners . 
6 And John 's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting : and they come and say unto him , Why do John 's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ? 
7 And Jesus said unto them , Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then will they fast . 
8 And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment , for its filling up takes from the garment and a worse rent takes place . 
9 Nor do men put new wine into old bottles , else the new wine will burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles . 
10 And it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn . 
11 And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ? 
12 And he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was hungry , he and they that were with him ? 
13 How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the showbread , which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests , and gave also to them that were with him ? 
14 And he said unto them , The sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath : 
15 so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath .

1 Jesus therefore , therefore , six days before the passover , came to Bethany , where was Lazarus that was dead , whom he raised out of the dead . 
2 So they made him a supper there : and Martha served ; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him . 
3 Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment . 
4 Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , which should betray him , 
5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings , and given to the poor ? 
6 This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bore what was put therein . 
7 Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burial hath she kept this . 
8 For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always . 
9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead . 
10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ; 
11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus . 
12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , 
13 Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord . 
14 And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written , 
15 Fear not , daughter of Zion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt . 
16 These things his disciples understood not at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written concerning him , and that they had done these things to him . 
17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare testimony . 
18 For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle . 
19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him . 
20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast : 
21 The same came therefore to Philip , which was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus . 
22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus . 
23 And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified . 
24 Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . 
25 He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal . 
26 If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will the Father honor . 
27 Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour . 
28 Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . 
29 The people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him . 
30 Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes . 
31 Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out . 
32 And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me . 
33 This he said , signifying what death he should die . 
34 The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ? 
35 Jesus therefore said to them , Yet a little while is the light among you . Walk while ye have the light , that darkness overtake you not : and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth . 
36 While ye have the light , believe on the light , that ye may become sons of light . Jesus said these things , and going away hid himself from them . 
37 But though he had done so many signs before them , yet they believed not on him : 
38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ? 
39 Therefore they could not believe , because that Isaiah said again , 
40 He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them . 
41 These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him . 
42 Nevertheless , among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue : 
43 for they loved the glory ' that is ' of men more than the glory ' that is ' of God . 
44 And Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me ; 
45 and he that beholds me , seeth him that sent me . 
46 I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in darkness . 
47 And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world . 
48 He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day . 
49 For I have not spoken from myself ; but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak . 
50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever I speak therefore , even as the Father said to me , so I speak .

12

1 And when he had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , that one of you shall betray me . 
2 The disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake . 
3 Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom , one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved . 
4 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , to ask who it should be of whom he spoke . 
5 He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ? 
6 Jesus answered , He it is to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon . 
7 And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , What thou doest , do quickly . 
8 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him . 
9 For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said to him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor . 
10 He then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night . 
11 Therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him . 
12 If God is glorified in him , God also shall glorify him in himself , and shall glorify him immediately . 
13 Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say unto you . 
14 A new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . 
15 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another . 
16 Simon Peter said to him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterward . 
17 Peter said to him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake . 
18 Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .

13

1 Peter saith unto him , Thou hast said . If thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world . 
2 For neither did his brethren believe in him . 
3 Then Jesus said to them , My time is not yet come : but your time is always ready . 
4 The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that its works are evil . 
5 Go ye up unto this feast : I go not yet to this feast , for my time is not yet full come . 
6 When he had said these words to them , he abode still in Galilee . 
7 But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up to the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret . 
8 Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ? 
9 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , No ; but he deceives the crowd . 
10 Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews . 
11 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught . 
12 And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? 
13 Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me . 
14 If any man will do his will , he shall know concerning the doctrine , whether it is of God , or whether I speak from myself . 
15 He that speaketh from himself , seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him . 
16 Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ? 
17 The people answered and said , Thou hast a demon : who goeth about to kill thee ? 
18 Jesus answered and said to them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel . 
19 Moses therefore gave to you circumcision , ( not because it is from Moses , but from the fathers ) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man . 
20 If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ? 
21 Judge not according to sight , but judge righteous judgment . 
22 Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ? 
23 and lo , he speaketh openly , and they say nothing to him . Do it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ ? 
24 Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when the Christ cometh , no one knoweth whence he is . 
25 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not . 
26 But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me . 
27 Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come . 
28 And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ? 
29 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him : and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him . 
30 Then said Jesus to them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go to him that sent me . 
31 Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come . 
32 Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ? 
33 What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye will seek me , and will not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come ? 
34 In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me and drink . 
35 He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . 
36 ( But this he spoke of the Spirit , which they that believe on him were to receive : for the Spirit was not yet ' given ' ; because Jesus was not yet glorified . 
37 Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , In truth this is the Prophet . 
38 Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ? 
39 Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ? 
40 So there was a division among the people because of him . 
41 And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him . 
42 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said to them , Why have ye not brought him ? 
43 The officers answered , Never man spoke like this man . 
44 Then the Pharisees answered them , Are ye also deceived ? 
45 Have any of the rulers , or of the Pharisees believed on him ? 
46 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed . 
47 Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them ) 
48 Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him , and knoweth what he doeth ? 
49 They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet . 
50 And every man went to his own house .

1 I have not chosen that I came to you ; but I chose away , and I come unto you . 
2 Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also . 
3 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you . 
4 He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him . 
5 Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us , and not to the world ? 
6 Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my word : and my Father will love him , and we will come to him , and make our abode with him . 
7 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's who sent me . 
8 These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you . 
9 But the Comforter , who is the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said to you . 
10 Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . 
11 Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again to you . If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go to the Father : for my Father is greater than I. 
12 And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he . 
13 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me . 
14 When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me . 
15 The disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake . 
16 Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom , one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved . 
17 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke . 
18 He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ? 
19 Jesus answered , He it is to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon . 
20 And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , What thou doest , do quickly . 
21 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him . 
22 For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said to him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor . 
23 He then having received the sop , went immediately out : and it was night . 
24 Therefore when he had gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him . 
25 If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him . 
26 Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said to the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say unto you . 
27 A new commandment I give to you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . 
28 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another . 
29 Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterward . 
30 Peter said to him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake . 
31 Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .

16

1 Ye therefore do not believe me , for I have known you , that ye have not the love of God in you . 
2 I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive . 
3 How can ye believe , who receive glory one of another , and the glory that ' cometh ' from the only God ? 
4 And if I should dismiss them to you , ye shall not believe . 
5 They shall put you out of the synagogues : yes , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you , he shall do ; and he shall shew you a large upper , and will go unto him . 
6 Therefore I say unto you , that no man can come to me , except it be given unto him of the Father . 
7 Upon this many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him . 
8 Then said Jesus unto the twelve , Will ye also go away ? 
9 Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life . 
10 And we believe , and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God . 
11 Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ? 
12 He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for it was he that was to betray him , being one of the twelve .

17

1 As the Father hath not known me , I have known me , and I lay down my life for the sheep . 
2 And other sheep I have which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd . 
3 Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again . 
4 No one taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received of my Father . 
5 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings . 
6 And many of them said , He hath a demon , and is mad ; why hear ye him ? 
7 Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a devil . Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ? 
8 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter . 
9 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon 's porch . 
10 Then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou art the Christ , tell us plainly . 
11 Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I did in my Father 's name , they testify concerning me . 
12 But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you . 
13 My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me : 
14 and I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , and no one shall snatch them out of my hand . 
15 My Father , who hath given ' them ' unto me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father . 
16 I and the Father are one . 
17 The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him . 
18 Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewn you of my Father : for which work of them do ye stone me ? 
19 The Jews answered him , saying , For a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy , and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God . 
20 Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ? 
21 If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came , and the scripture can not be broken ; 
22 Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ? 
23 If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not . 
24 But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in him . 
25 Therefore they sought again to take him ; but he escaped from their hand , 
26 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized ; and there he abode . 
27 And many resorted unto him , and said , John did no miracle : but all things that John spake of this man were true . 
28 And many believed on him there .

1 And Jesus asked them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified . 
2 Verily , verily , I say to you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . 
3 He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal . 
4 If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honor . 
5 Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour . 
6 Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . 
7 The people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it had thundered : others said , An angel hath spoken to him . 
8 Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes . 
9 Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out . 
10 And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me . 
11 ( This he said , signifying what death he should die . 
12 The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ? 
13 Jesus therefore said unto them , Yet a little while is the light among you . Walk while ye have the light , that darkness overtake you not : and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth . 
14 While ye have the light , believe in the light , that ye may become sons of light . Jesus said these things , and going away hid himself from them . 
15 But though he had done so many signs before them , yet they believed not on him : 
16 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ? 
17 For this cause they could not believe , because that Isaiah said again , 
18 He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them . 
19 These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him . 
20 Nevertheless , among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue : 
21 for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God . 
22 And Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me ; 
23 and he that beholds me , beholds him that sent me . 
24 I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in darkness . 
25 And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world . 
26 He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my sayings , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day . 
27 For I have not spoken from myself ; but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak . 
28 And I know that his commandment is life eternal : the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father hath said unto me , so I speak .

1 In the resurrection therefore , when they had dined , and having seen the things that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world . 
2 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again to a mountain himself alone . 
3 And when evening came , his disciples went down to the sea ; 
4 and they entered into a boat , and were going over the sea unto Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them . 
5 And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew . 
6 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid . 
7 But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid . 
8 They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they were going . 
9 The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , save that one into which his disciples had entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples had gone away alone ; 
10 ( howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh to the place where they ate bread , after the Lord had given thanks : ) 
11 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus . 
12 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ? 
13 Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye ate of the loaves , and were filled . 
14 Work not for the food which perisheth , but for that food which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man will give to you : for him hath God the Father sealed . 
15 Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we may work the works of God ? 
16 Jesus answered and said to them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent . 
17 They said therefore unto him , What sign showest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ? 
18 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . 
19 Jesus therefore said unto them , Verily , verily , I say to you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in yourselves . 
20 He that eats my flesh and drinketh my blood has life eternal , and I will raise him up at the last day . 
21 For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed . 
22 He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwells in me and I in him . 
23 As the living Father has sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me . 
24 This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers ate manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever . 
25 These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum . 
26 Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is a hard saying ; who can hear it ? 
27 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , Doth this offend you ? 
28 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ? 
29 It is the spirit that reviveth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life . 
30 But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who he should deliver him up . 
31 And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no one can come to me , except it were given unto him from my Father . 
32 From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him . 
33 Then said Jesus to the twelve , Will ye also go away ? 
34 Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life . 
35 And we believe , and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God . 
36 Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ? 
37 He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for it was he that was to betray him , being one of the twelve .
