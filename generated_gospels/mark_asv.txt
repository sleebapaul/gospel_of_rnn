1 And And as he entered into the boat , his disciples asked him privately , 
2 Why do the scribes say that Elijah must first come ? 
3 And he answered and said unto them , Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things . 
4 But I say unto you that Elias has already come , and they have not known him , but have done unto him whatever they would . Likewise also the Son of man is about to suffer from them . 
5 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist . 
6 And when they came to the crowd , there came to him a man , kneeling down to him , and saying , 
7 Lord , have mercy on my son : for he is lunatick , and sore vexed : for ofttimes he falls into the fire , and oft into the water . 
8 And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him . 
9 Then Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither . 
10 And as he was yet coming , the demon threw him down , and tore him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and gave him back to his father . 
11 And they were all astonished at the majesty of God . But while they were all wondering at all things which Jesus did , he said to his disciples , 
12 Do * ye * let these words sink into your ears . For the Son of man is about to be delivered into men 's hands . 
13 But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it : and they feared to ask him concerning this saying . 
14 And there arose a reasoning among them , which of them was the greatest . 
15 But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart , he took a little child , and set him by his side , 
16 and said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me . For he who is the least among you all , * he * is great . 
17 And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followeth not with us . 
18 But Jesus said to him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us , is for us . 
19 And it came to pass , when the days were well - nigh come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem , 
20 And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him . 
21 And they did not receive him , because his face was ' as though he were ' going to Jerusalem . 
22 And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elijah did ? 
23 But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of . 
24 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . And they went to another village . 
25 And it came to pass , that as they were going in , behold , the men were astonished , saying , Who has this [ man ] these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ? 
26 Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joses , and of Juda , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended in him . 
27 But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house . 
28 And he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them . 
29 And he marvelled because of their unbelief . And he went round about the villages teaching . 
30 And he calleth unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ; 
31 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse : 
32 But be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats . 
33 And he said unto them , In what place ye enter into a house , there abide till ye depart from that place . 
34 And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet , for a testimony against them . Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city . 
35 And they went out and preached that men should repent . 
36 And they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them . 
37 And king Herod heard of him ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist had risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him . 
38 Others said , That it is Elias . And others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets . 
39 But when Herod heard thereof , he said , It is John , whom I beheaded : he is risen from the dead . 
40 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her . 
41 For John said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife . 
42 And Herodias set herself against him , and desired to kill him ; and she could not : 
43 for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just and holy man , and observed him : and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly . 
44 And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ; 
45 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod , and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee . 
46 And he swore unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom . 
47 And she went forth , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptist . 
48 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist . 
49 And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her . 
50 And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison , 
51 And brought his head in a dish , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother . 
52 And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb . 
53 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught . 
54 And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while . For there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat . 
55 And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart . 
56 And the people ' saw them , as they followed , and were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen to him , 
57 Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles : 
58 and they shall mock him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .

1 And And going away from thence , he came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God , 
2 And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel . 
3 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers . 
4 And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men . 
5 And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him . 
6 And when he had gone a little farther thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the boat mending their nets . 
7 And immediately he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him . 
8 And they go into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught . 
9 And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes . 
10 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out , 
11 Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God . 
12 And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . 
13 And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him . 
14 And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . 
15 And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around . 
16 And straightway , when they had come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John . 
17 Now Simon 's wife 's mother was sick of a fever ; and straightway they tell him of her : 
18 and he came and took her by the hand , and raised her up ; and the fever left her , and she ministered unto them . 
19 And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with demons . 
20 And all the city was gathered together at the door . 
21 And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases , and cast out many demons ; and suffered not the demons to speak , because they knew him . 
22 And in the morning , rising a great while before day , he went out and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed . 
23 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him ; 
24 and they found him , and say unto him , All are seeking thee . 
25 And he saith unto them , Let us go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for to this end came I forth . 
26 And he went away from them , and passed by , and saw a great multitude , and he was moved with compassion for them , and did heal their infirm ; 
27 and evening having come , his disciples came to him , saying , The place is desert , and the time is already past ; send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . 
28 But Jesus said to them , They have no need to go : give ye them to eat . 
29 And they say unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes . 
30 He said , Bring them hither to me . 
31 And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes . 
32 And they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , twelve baskets full . 
33 And they that did eat were four thousand men , besides women and children . 
34 And he sent away the multitudes , and entered into the boat , and came into the borders of Magadan .

1 And the mother of the child , answered him , saying , Master , behold , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee : 
2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him . 
3 And this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent . 
4 I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do . 
5 And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was . 
6 I have manifested thy name to the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them to me ; and they have kept thy word . 
7 Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee : 
8 for the words which thou hast given me I have given them , and they have received [ them ] , and have known truly that I came out from thee , and have believed that thou sentest me . 
9 I demand concerning them ; I do not demand concerning the world , but concerning those whom thou hast given me , for they are thine , 
10 and all things that are mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them . 
11 And I am no more in the world , and these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep them in thy name which thou hast given me , that they may be one , even as we ' are ' . 
12 While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me I have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled . 
13 And now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves . 
14 I have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , as I am not of the world . 
15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil . 
16 They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world . 
17 Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth . 
18 As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world . 
19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth . 
20 Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ; 
21 That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me . 
22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them , that they may be one , even as we are one ; 
23 I in them , and thou in me , that they may be perfected into one [ and ] that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them as thou hast loved me . 
24 Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory which thou hast given to me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world . 
25 O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me . 
26 And I have declared to them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .

1 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming forth out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way . 
2 And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ? 
3 And there was much murmuring about him among the crowds : for some said , He is a good man : others said , No ; but he deceiveth the people . 
4 Howbeit , no man spoke openly of him , for fear of the Jews . 
5 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught . 
6 And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? 
7 Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me . 
8 If any man will do his will , he shall know concerning the doctrine , whether it is of God , or ' whether ' I speak from myself . 
9 He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him . 
10 Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you doeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ? 
11 The people answered and said , Thou hast a demon : who goeth about to kill thee ? 
12 Jesus answered and said to them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel . 
13 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is from Moses , but from the fathers ) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man . 
14 If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision , that the law of Moses may not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ? 
15 Judge not according to sight , but judge righteous judgment . 
16 Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ? 
17 and behold , he speaks openly , and they say nothing unto him . Do it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ ? 
18 Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when the Christ cometh , no one knoweth whence he is . 
19 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am ; and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not . 
20 But I know him ; for I am from him , and he sent me . 
21 They sought therefore to take him : and no man laid his hand on him , because his hour was not yet come . 
22 But of the multitude many believed on him ; and they said , When the Christ is come , will he do more signs than these which this man hath done ? 
23 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him . 
24 Then said Jesus to them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go to him that sent me . 
25 Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , ye can not come . 
26 The Jews therefore said among themselves , Whither will this man go that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ? 
27 What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye will seek me , and will not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come ? 
28 In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me and drink . 
29 He that believes on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . 
30 ( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . ) 
31 Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , In truth this is the Prophet . 
32 Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ? 
33 Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ? 
34 So there was a division among the people because of him . 
35 And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him . 
36 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said to them , Why have ye not brought him ? 
37 The officers answered , Never man spoke like this man . 
38 Then the Pharisees answered them , Are ye also deceived ? 
39 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ? 
40 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed . 
41 Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , ) 
42 Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him , and knoweth what he doeth ? 
43 They answered and said to him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet . 
44 And every man went to his own house .

1 And he said to his disciples , What is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast the seed upon the sabbath ? 
2 And they had no more to a feast , but his word was still . 
3 And when they were unable to pay ' it ' , they let down the multitude on a couch , and to lay him on the cross . 
4 And having taken the seven loaves , he went up to the mountain , and saw the man : for he was near to die . 
5 And when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God . 
6 Verily I say to you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein . 
7 And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? 
8 And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , ' even ' God . 
9 Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honor thy father and mother . 
10 And he answered and said unto him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth . 
11 And Jesus looking upon him loved him , and said unto him , One thing lackest thou : go , sell whatever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . 
12 But when the young man heard the saying , he went away sorrowful ; for he had great possessions . 
13 And Jesus looked around , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! 
14 And the disciples were astonished at his words . And Jesus again answering says to them , Children , how difficult it is that those who trust in riches should enter into the kingdom of God ! 
15 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . 
16 And they were astonished exceedingly , saying unto him , Then who can be saved ? 
17 Jesus looking on them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for all things are possible with God . 
18 Peter began to say unto him , Lo , * we * have left all things and have followed thee . 
19 Jesus answering said , Verily I say to you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel 's , 
20 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life . 
21 But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first . 
22 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him , 
23 Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles : 
24 and they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again . 
25 And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , come unto him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire . 
26 And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ? 
27 They said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory . 
28 But Jesus said to them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? 
29 And they said unto him , We can . And Jesus said to them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized : 
30 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand , is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared . 
31 And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John . 
32 But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them ; and their great ones exercise authority over them . 
33 But it is not so among you : but whosoever would become great among you , shall be your minister ; 
34 and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant : 
35 even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . 
36 And they come to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging . 
37 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me . 
38 And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me . 
39 And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee . 
40 And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus . 
41 And Jesus answered and said unto him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? The blind man said unto him , Lord , that I may receive my sight . 
42 And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .

1 And his parents became shining , and his raiment white as snow : 
2 and for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men . 
3 And the angel answering said to the women , Fear not ye ; for I know that ye seek Jesus , who hath been crucified . 
4 He is not here ; for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay . 
5 And go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he speaketh of the man , ) 
6 and because of the mighty , the chief priests and the scribes had given commandment that they might take him by craft , and put him to death . 
7 But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people . 
8 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of pure nard , very costly ; and having broken the alabaster flask , she poured it out upon his head . 
9 And there were some indignant in themselves , and saying , Why did this waste been made of the ointment ? 
10 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her . 
11 But Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me . 
12 For ye have the poor with you always , and whenever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always . 
13 She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying . 
14 Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of , for a memorial of her . 
15 And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went away unto the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them . 
16 And they , when they heard it , were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray him . 
17 And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said to him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ? 
18 And he sendeth two of his disciples , and saith to them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him . 
19 And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guest - chamber , where I may eat the passover with my disciples ? 
20 And he will show you a large upper room furnished : there make ready . 
21 And they went and found as he had said to them : and they made ready the passover . 
22 And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him . 
23 And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer : 
24 for I say unto you , that I will not eat any more at all of it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . 
25 And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves : 
26 for I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come . 
27 And he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he distributed to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body . 
28 And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it . 
29 And he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many . 
30 Verily I say to you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God . 
31 And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives . 
32 And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad . 
33 But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee . 
34 But Peter said to him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I. 
35 And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that thou to - day , in this night , before [ the ] cock shall crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . 
36 Peter says to him , If I should needs die with thee , I will in no wise deny thee . Likewise said all the disciples also . 
37 Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , Sit ye here , while I go yonder and pray . 
38 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy . 
39 Then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : abide ye here , and watch with me . 
40 And he went forward a little , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass away from me ; nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt . 
41 And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ? 
42 Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . 
43 And again he went away , and prayed , and spoke the same words . 
44 And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him . 
45 And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . 
46 Arise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that betrayeth me . 
47 And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders . 
48 Now he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely . 
49 And as soon as he was come , he goeth immediately to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him . 
50 And they laid their hands on him , and took him . 
51 But one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear . 
52 And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staffs to take me ? 
53 I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but ' this is done ' that the scriptures might be fulfilled . 
54 And they all left him , and fled . 
55 And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him : 
56 And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked . 
57 And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes . 
58 And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .

1 And For the day of the multitude drew near , in which , to the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples , 
2 and saith unto them , Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye have entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him . 
3 And if any one say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither . 
4 And they went , and found the colt tied by the door without , in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him . 
5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ? 
6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go . 
7 And they brought the colt unto Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him . 
8 And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off trees , and strewed them in the way . 
9 And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord : 
10 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest . 
11 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , it being now evening , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve . 
12 And on the morrow , when they were come out of Bethany , he hungered . 
13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves : for the time of figs had not yet come . 
14 And Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you and suffer you ? bring hither thy son . 
15 But as he was yet coming , the demon tore him and dragged him all together . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and gave him back to his father . 
16 And they were all amazed at the majesty of God . But while they were all wondering at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples , 
17 Let these words sink down into your ears : for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men . 
18 But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it : and they feared to ask him concerning this saying . 
19 And there arose a reasoning among them , which of them was the greatest . 
20 But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart , he took a little child , and set him by his side , 
21 and said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me . 
22 And John answered him , saying , Master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followeth not with us . 
23 And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us , is for us . 
24 And it came to pass , when the days were well - nigh to the land that they were going , behold , two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment . 
25 And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground , they said to them , Why seek ye the living one among the dead ? 
26 He is not here , but is risen . Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee , 
27 saying , The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners , and they shall kill him ; and when he is killed , after three days he shall rise again . 
28 But they understood not the saying , and feared to ask him . 
29 And they came to Capernaum : and when he was in the house he asked them , What were ye reasoning on the way ? 
30 But they held their peace : for they had disputed one with another on the way , who ' was ' the greatest . 
31 And he asked them , What things ? And they said to him , The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ; 
32 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [ the ] judgment of death and crucified him . 
33 But * we * had hoped that * he * was [ the ] Christ , making himself equal with God . 
34 Then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say to you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . 
35 For the Father loveth the Son , and showeth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel . 
36 For as the Father raiseth the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son reviveth whom he will . 
37 For the Father judgeth no man ; but hath committed all judgment to the Son : 
38 That all men should honor the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father who hath sent him . 
39 Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth him that sent me , hath eternal life , and cometh not into judgment , but hath passed out of death into life . 
40 Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour cometh , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God ; and they that hear shall live . 
41 For as the Father hath life in himself , so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ; 
42 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man . 
43 Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice , 
44 And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation . 
45 I can of my own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not my own will , but the will of the Father who sent me . 
46 If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . 
47 There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the testimony which he witnesseth of me is true . 
48 Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth . 
49 But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye may be saved . 
50 He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light . 
51 But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me . 
52 And the Father himself who hath sent me , hath borne witness concerning me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape . 
53 And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not . 
54 Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me . 
55 And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life . 
56 I receive not honour from men . 
57 But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you . 
58 I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .

1 But Peter said to him , I know that Messias cometh , who is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things . 
2 Then Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , Except thou be converted . 
3 And he saith to him , Verily I say to thee , that this day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . 
4 But he spake the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all . 
5 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith unto his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray . 
6 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be greatly amazed , and to be very heavy ; 
7 And saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful to death : tarry ye here , and watch . 
8 And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible the hour of the prophet , he would have watched [ him ] . 
9 And they , having heard the word , went away straightway out of the country of the Gadarenes . 
10 And when he had come out of the boat , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit , 
11 Who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains : 
12 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him . 
13 And always , night and day , he was on the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones . 
14 And when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him , 
15 And cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the Most High God ? I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not . 
16 For he said to him , Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit . 
17 And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he answered , saying , My name is Legion : for we are many . 
18 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country . 
19 Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding ; 
20 and they besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them . 
21 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea ( they were about two thousand ) and were choked in the sea , and they brought together unto their own the fishes . 
22 And they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that had come to pass . 
23 And they come to Jesus , and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting , clothed and in his right mind , ' even ' him that had the legion ; and they were afraid . 
24 And they that saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed with the demon , and also concerning the swine . 
25 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts . 
26 And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him . 
27 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not , but saith to him , Go to thy house unto thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and ' how ' he had mercy on thee . 
28 And he went his way , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him ; and all men did marvel . 
29 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea . 
30 And , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet , 
31 And besought him greatly , saying , My little daughter lieth at the point of death : I pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she shall live . 
32 And Jesus went with him ; and many people followed him , and thronged him . 
33 And a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years , 
34 And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse , 
35 having heard the things concerning Jesus , came in the crowd behind , and touched his garment . 
36 For she said , If I may touch but his clothes , I shall be whole . 
37 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that infirmity . 
38 And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the throng , and said , Who touched my clothes ? 
39 And his disciples said to him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ? 
40 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing . 
41 But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth . 
42 And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague . 
43 While he yet spake , they come from the ruler of the synagogue 's ' house ' saying , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ? 
44 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe . 
45 And he suffered no one to accompany him save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James . 
46 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly . 
47 And when he was come in , he saith to them , Why make ye this tumult , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth . 
48 And they laughed him to scorn . But when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying . 
49 And he took the damsel by the hand , and said unto her , Talitha cumi : which is , being interpreted , Damsel , I say unto thee , Arise . 
50 And straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment . 
51 And he charged them strictly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .

1 By this manner , therefore , the second ' same ' is ' the miracle , when they were gone out of the city , and went into the swine , and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake , and were choked . 
2 But they that fed [ them ] , seeing what had happened , fled , and told [ it ] to the city and to the country . 
3 And they went out to see what had happened , and came to Jesus , and found the man out of whom the demons had departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid . 
4 And they that saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine . 
5 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts . 
6 And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the demon prayed him that he might be with him . 
7 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not , but saith to him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee . 
8 And he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him ; and all men marvelled . 
9 And when Jesus had passed over again in the boat unto the other side , a great multitude gathered unto him ; and he was by the sea . 
10 And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and seeing him , he falleth at his feet , 
11 and beseecheth him much , saying , My little daughter is at the point of death : I pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she will live . 
12 And Jesus went with him ; and many people followed him , and thronged him . 
13 And a certain woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years , 
14 And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse , 
15 When she had heard of Jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment . 
16 For she said , If I touch but his garments , I shall be made whole . 
17 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that infirmity . 
18 And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the throng , and said , Who touched my clothes ? 
19 And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ? 
20 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing . 
21 But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth . 
22 And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague . 
23 While he yet spake , they come from the ruler of the synagogue 's [ house ] , saying , Thy daughter has died , why troublest thou the teacher any further ? 
24 But Jesus , hearing their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand : 
25 And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom stand ? 
26 And if * I * cast out demons by Beelzebub , your sons , by whom do they cast [ them ] out ? For this reason * they * shall be your judges . 
27 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then is the kingdom of God come upon you . 
28 When the strong ' man ' fully armed guardeth his own court , his goods are in peace : 
29 but when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils . 
30 He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth . 
31 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest : and finding none , he saith , I will return to my house whence I came out . 
32 And having come , he finds it swept and adorned . 
33 Then he goeth and takes seven other spirits worse than himself , and entering in , they dwell there ; and the last condition of that man is worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation . 
34 While he yet talked to the crowds , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him . 
35 Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , seeking to speak to thee . 
36 But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ? 
37 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren ! 
38 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .

1 And the multitude went out , and began to dispute him . 
2 But he went out early , and it was as he had said to them : and they made ready the passover . 
3 And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him . 
4 And he said unto them , I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer . 
5 For I say unto you , I will not any more eat of it until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . 
6 And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves . 
7 For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come . 
8 And he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and gave to them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me . 
9 In like manner also the cup after , the cup concerning the law , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any one thirst , let him come to me and drink . 
10 He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . 
11 ( But this he spoke of the Spirit , which they that believe on him were about to receive ; for the Spirit was not yet ' given ' ; because Jesus was not yet glorified . 
12 ' Some ' of the multitude therefore , when they heard this saying , said , In truth this is the Prophet . 
13 Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ? 
14 Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh from the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ? 
15 So there was a division among the people because of him . 
16 And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him . 
17 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said to them , Why did ye not bring him ? 
18 The officers answered , Never man spake like this man . 
19 Then the Pharisees answered them , Are ye also deceived ? 
20 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ? 
21 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed . 
22 Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , ) 
23 Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him , and knoweth what he doeth ? 
24 They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet . 
25 And every man went unto his own house .

1 And what think ye ? A man had two children ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my vineyard . 
2 And he said , I will not : but afterward he repented , and went . 
3 And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I ' go ' , sir : and went not . 
4 Which of the two did the will of the father ? They say [ to him ] , The first . Jesus says to them , Verily I say unto you , that the tax - gatherers and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you . 
5 For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not ; but the tax - gatherers and the harlots believed him : but * ye * when ye saw [ it ] repented not yourselves afterwards to believe him . 
6 Hear another parable : There was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country . 
7 And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard . 
8 And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty . 
9 And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled . 
10 And again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some . 
11 Having yet therefore one son , his well - beloved , he sent him also last to them , saying , They will reverence my son . 
12 But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be our 's . 
13 And they took him , and killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard . 
14 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . 
15 Have ye not read even this scripture : The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ; 
16 This was from the Lord , And it is marvellous in our eyes ? 
17 And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way . 
18 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , to catch him in his words . 
19 And when they were come , they say unto him , Master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men , but of a truth teachest the way of God : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ? 
20 Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it . 
21 And they brought it . And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar 's . 
22 And Jesus answering said to them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's . And they marvelled at him . 
23 Then come to him the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying , 
24 Master , Moses wrote unto us , If a man 's brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed to his brother . 
25 Now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed . 
26 And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise . 
27 And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also . 
28 In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her for a wife . 
29 And Jesus answering , said to them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ? 
30 For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as angels in heaven . 
31 But as touching the dead , that they are raised ; have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spoke to him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? 
32 He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err . 
33 And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ? 
34 And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord . 
35 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength . 
36 The second is this , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . There is none other commandment greater than these . 
37 And the scribe said to him , Of a truth , Teacher , thou hast well said that he is one ; and there is none other but he : 
38 And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more than all whole burnt - offerings and sacrifices . 
39 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question . 
40 And Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David ? 
41 For David himself said by the Holy Spirit , The LORD said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool . 
42 David therefore himself calleth him Lord , and whence is he then his son ? And the common people heard him gladly . 
43 And he said to them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes , and salutations in the marketplaces , 
44 and first seats in the synagogues , and first places at suppers ; 
45 who devour the houses of widows , and as a pretext make long prayers . These shall receive a severer judgment . 
46 And Jesus , having sat down opposite the treasury , saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury : and many rich cast in much . 
47 And a poor widow came and cast in two mites , which is a farthing . 
48 And behold , there was a certain dropsical man before him . 
49 And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ? 
50 And they held their peace . And he took him and healed him , and let him go ; 
51 And answered him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that struck thee ? And Peter said , Man , I am not . 
52 And after the space of about one hour another stoutly maintained it , saying , In truth this [ man ] also was with him , for also he is a Galilaean . 
53 And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he was yet speaking , the cock crowed . 
54 And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he said to him , Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice . 
55 And he went out , and wept bitterly . 
56 And the men that held ' Jesus ' mocked him , and beat him . 
57 And they blindfolded him , and asked him , saying , Prophesy : who is he that struck thee ? 
58 And many other things blasphemously they spoke against him .

12

1 And again he went forth , and went into the villages , and sat down . And the whole multitude stood on the shore . 
2 And he spake unto them many things in parables , saying , Behold , the sower went out to sow ; 
3 and as he sowed , some ' seeds ' fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured them : 
4 and others fell upon the rocky places , where they had not much earth : and straightway they sprang up , because they had no deepness of earth : 
5 And when the sun was risen , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away . 
6 And others fell upon the thorns ; and the thorns grew up and choked them : 
7 and others fell upon the good ground , and yielded fruit , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty . 
8 He that hath ears , let him hear . 
9 And the disciples came , and said unto him , Why speakest thou unto them in parables ? 
10 He answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given . 
11 For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath . 
12 And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ; 
13 And should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how . 
14 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear . 
15 But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come . 
16 And he said , Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ? 
17 It is like a grain of mustard - seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that are in the earth . 
18 But when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under its shade . 
19 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it . 
20 But without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples . 
21 And the same day , when the evening was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side . 
22 And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the boat . And there were also with him other small boats . 
23 And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full . 
24 And he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ? 
25 And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . 
26 And he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ? 
27 And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?

1 After that which he spake to the people , and * they * were in the synagogue , as many as had plagues . 
2 But when the sun was risen , he was manifested in the form of the wilderness , and the earth was shut upon the land , and the birds of the air lodged in the branches of it . 
3 And again he said to them , When ye pray , say , Father , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . 
4 Give us day by day our daily bread . 
5 And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors . 
6 And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . 
7 Verily I say unto you , there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . 
8 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what ' shall be ' the sign when these things are all about to be fulfilled ? 
9 And Jesus began to say unto them , Take heed that no man lead you astray . 
10 Many shall come in my name , saying , I am ' he ' ; and shall lead many astray . 
11 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars . See that ye be not disturbed : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet . 
12 For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places . 
13 All these are the beginning of sorrows . 
14 Then shall they deliver you up to tribulation , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name 's sake . 
15 And then will many be offended , and will deliver one another up , and hate one another ; 
16 and many false prophets shall arise , and shall lead many astray . 
17 And because iniquity shall be multiplied , the love of the many shall wax cold . 
18 But he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved . 
19 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations ; and then shall the end come . 
20 When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let him that readeth understand ) , then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains : 
21 and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house : 
22 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment . 
23 But woe to them that are with child , and to them that nurse infants in those days . 
24 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter . 
25 For in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time , neither shall be . 
26 And except the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh would be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days . 
27 And then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is Christ ; or lo , he is there ; believe him not . 
28 For false Christs , and false prophets will rise , and will show signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect . 
29 But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things . 
30 But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , 
31 And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken . 
32 And then they shall see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory . 
33 And then shall he send forth his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven . 
34 Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh : 
35 So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors . 
36 Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done . 
37 Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away . 
38 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father . 
39 Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is . 
40 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch . 
41 Watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at evening , or at midnight , or at the cock - crowing , or in the morning : 
42 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping . 
43 And what I say unto you , I say to all , Watch .

1 And straightway the devil having torn him , and uttered a cry , and came upon him . 
2 And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . 
3 And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee round about . 
4 And straightway , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John . 
5 Now Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fever ; and straightway they tell him of her . 
6 And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them . 
7 And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with demons . 
8 And all the city was gathered together at the door . 
9 And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases , and cast out many demons ; and suffered not the demons to speak , because they knew him . 
10 And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed . 
11 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him . 
12 And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee . 
13 And he said unto them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also ; for for this purpose came I forth . 
14 And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee , preaching and casting out demons . 
15 And there came to him great multitudes , having with them the lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and they cast them down at this feet ; and he healed them : 
16 insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb speaking , the maimed whole , and lame walking , and the blind seeing : and they glorified the God of Israel . 
17 And Jesus called his disciples to him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way . 
18 And his disciples say unto him , Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place , and as they were [ the ] greatest . 
19 And he said to them , How do ye say that the Christ is David 's son ? 
20 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , 
21 Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet . 
22 David himself calleth him Lord , and whence is he his son ? And the common people heard him gladly . 
23 And in his teaching he said , Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and to have salutations in the market - places , 
24 and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts ; 
25 who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .

1 And when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . 
2 And he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou made clean . And straightway the leprosy departed from him . 
3 And he charged him to tell no man : but go thy way , and show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them . 
4 But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed of their infirmities . 
5 But he withdrew himself in the deserts , and prayed . 
6 And it came to pass on one of those days , that he was teaching , and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and [ out of ] Jerusalem : and [ the ] Lord 's power was [ there ] to heal them . 
7 And behold , men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed ; and they sought to bring him in , and put [ him ] before him . 
8 And not finding what way to bring him in , on account of the crowd , going up on the housetop they let him down through the tiles , and laid his hands upon him , and took him . 
9 And a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword , and smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear . 
10 And Jesus answering said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staffs to take me ? 
11 I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but ' this is done ' that the scriptures might be fulfilled . 
12 And they all left him , and fled . 
13 And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him . 
14 And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked . 
15 And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes . 
16 And Peter followed him at a distance , even into the palace of the high priest ; and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire . 
17 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none . 
18 For many bore false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together . 
19 And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying , 
20 We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands . 
21 And neither so did their witness agree together . 
22 And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ? 
23 But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ , the Son of God . 
24 Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power , and coming on the clouds of heaven . 
25 Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy : what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard the blasphemy : 
26 what think ye ? They answered and said , He is worthy of death . 
27 Then did they spit in his face and buffet him : and some smote him with the palms of their hands , 
28 saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ : who is he that struck thee ? 
29 Now Peter was sitting without in the court : and a maid came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean . 
30 But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest . 
31 And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth . 
32 And again he denied with an oath : I do not know the man . 
33 And after a little , those who stood [ there ] , coming to [ him ] , said to Peter , Truly * thou * too art of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee . 
34 Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew . 
35 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , who said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly .
