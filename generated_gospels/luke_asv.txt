1 And it came to pass , after the days , they were astonished , and glorified God , who had been dead ; 
2 and Jesus saw the power of the Lord in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , 
3 Saying , Arise , take the pound , and give it to the poor , and if I have taken the sop from thee , I will give it thee . 
4 And he sware to her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask me I will give thee , to half of my kingdom . 
5 And she went out , and said to her mother , What should I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptist . 
6 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist . 
7 And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her . 
8 And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison , 
9 And brought his head in a dish , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother . 
10 And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb . 
11 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught . 
12 And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little . For those coming and those going were many , and they had not leisure even to eat . 
13 And they went away apart into a desert place by ship . 
14 And many saw them going , and recognised them , and ran together there on foot from all the cities , and outwent them . 
15 And he came forth and saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things . 
16 And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed : 
17 Send them away , that they may go into the country around , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat . 
18 He answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they say to him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ? 
19 He saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes . 
20 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass . 
21 And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties . 
22 And when he had taken the five loaves , and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all . 
23 And they all ate , and were filled . 
24 And they took up of fragments the fillings of twelve hand - baskets , and of the fishes . 
25 And those that ate of the loaves were five thousand men . 
26 And immediately he constrained his disciples to enter into a boat , and to go before him to the other side , till he should send the multitudes away . 
27 And after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain apart to pray : and when even was come , he was there alone . 
28 But the boat was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves ; for the wind was contrary . 
29 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them walking on the sea . 
30 And when they saw him walking on the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out . 
31 For all saw him and were troubled . And immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid . 
32 And he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered . 
33 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened . 
34 And when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore . 
35 And when they were come out of the ship , straightway ' the people ' knew him , 
36 and ran round about that whole region , and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick , where they heard he was . 
37 And whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole .

1 And the devil , having seen him walking on the sea , thought that it was [ the ] preparation , for they were holding the day . 
2 And it came to pass as he was in one of the cities , behold , a man full of leprosy : and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . 
3 And he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou made clean . And straightway the leprosy departed from him . 
4 And he enjoined him to tell no one ; but go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing as Moses ordained , for a testimony unto them . 
5 But so much the more a fame of him went abroad : and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities . 
6 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed . 
7 And it came to pass on one of those days , that he was teaching , and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and [ out of ] Jerusalem ; and [ the ] Lord 's power was [ there ] to heal them . 
8 And behold , men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed ; and they sought to bring him in , and to lay him before him . 
9 And not finding by what ' way ' they might bring him in because of the multitude , they uncovered the roof where he was , and having dug [ it ] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay . 
10 But Jesus , seeing their faith , says to the paralytic , Child , thy sins are forgiven [ thee ] . 
11 And certain of the scribes were there sitting , and reasoning in their hearts , 
12 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but God only ? 
13 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ? 
14 Which is easier , to say to the sick with the palsy , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ? 
15 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy ) , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go up unto thy house . 
16 And he arose , and departed to his house . 
17 But when the multitudes saw it , they were afraid , and glorified God , who had given such authority unto men . 
18 And as Jesus passed by from thence , he saw a man , called Matthew , sitting at the place of toll : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him . 
19 And it came to pass , that he was sitting at meat in his house , and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him . 
20 And the scribes and the Pharisees , seeing him eating with sinners and tax - gatherers , said to his disciples , Why [ is it ] that he eats and drinks with tax - gatherers and sinners ? 
21 And Jesus answering said to them , They that are in sound health have not need of a physician , but those that are ill . 
22 I am not come to call righteous [ persons ] , but sinful [ ones ] to repentance . 
23 And they said to him , Why do the disciples of John fast often and make supplications , in like manner those also of the Pharisees , but thine eat and drink ? 
24 And he said to them , Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast when the bridegroom is with them ? 
25 But days will come when also the bridegroom will have been taken away from them ; then shall they fast in those days . 
26 And he spoke also a parable to them : No one puts a piece of a new garment upon an old garment , otherwise he will both rend the new , and the piece which is from the new will not suit with the old . 
27 And no one puts new wine into old wine - skins : else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles will perish . 
28 But new wine must be put into new bottles , and both are preserved . 
29 No man also having drank old wine , immediately desireth new : for he saith , The old is better .

1 And it came to pass , as he went into the temple , one of his disciples said to him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples . 
2 And he said to them , When ye pray , say , Father , thy name be hallowed ; thy kingdom come ; 
3 give us our needed bread for each day ; 
4 and forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors . 
5 And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen . 
6 For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you . 
7 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . 
8 Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , They have received their reward . 
9 But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thy head , and wash thy face ; 
10 that thou be not seen of men to fast , but of thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , who seeth in secret , shall recompense thee . 
11 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal : 
12 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal : 
13 for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . 
14 Let your loins be girt , and your lights burning ; 
15 And ye yourselves like men who wait for their lord , when he shall return from the wedding ; that , when he cometh and knocketh , they may open to him immediately . 
16 Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to eat , and will come and serve them . 
17 And if he shall come in the second watch , and come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants . 
18 But this know , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken through . 
19 Therefore be ye also ready : for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh . 
20 Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath set over his household , to give them their food in due season ? 
21 Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing . 
22 Verily I say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath . 
23 But if that servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the men - servants , and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ? 
24 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him asunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers . 
25 And that servant who knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many ' stripes ' ; 
26 but he that knew not , and did things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few . And to every one to whom much has been given , much shall be required from him ; and to whom [ men ] have committed much , they will ask from him the more . 
27 I have come to cast a fire on the earth ; and what will I if already it has been kindled ? 
28 But I have a baptism to be baptised with , and how am I straitened until it shall have been accomplished ! 
29 Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division : 
30 For there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three . 
31 They shall be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against mother ; a mother - in - law against her daughter - in - law , and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law . 
32 And he said also unto the crowds , When ye see a cloud rising in the west , immediately ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it cometh to pass . 
33 And when ye see the south wind blowing , ye say , There will be heat ; and it cometh to pass . 
34 Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky , and of the earth ; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time ? 
35 And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ? 
36 For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate , on the way give diligence to be quit of him ; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge , and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer , and the officer shall cast thee into prison . 
37 I say unto thee , Thou shalt in no wise come out thence until thou hast paid the very last mite .

1 And there is one that is left , and the temple is the good : but the flesh weak , because he is the hireling . 
2 But he that is sown among the thorns is he that heareth the word , and the care of this age , and the deceitfulness of the riches , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful . 
3 And he that received seed among the thorns came to life ( and the good man hath done the Son , and understandeth the sheep . 
4 But he that is sown among the thorns , this is he who hears the word , and the anxious care of this life , and the deceit of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful . 
5 But he that is sown upon the good ground -- this is he who hears the word , and understandeth it ; who bears fruit , a hundred - fold , and having set the foundation , into the joy that is [ the ] foundation of the heavens , and the birds of the air , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful . 
6 And when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come . 
7 And he said , How should we liken the kingdom of God , or with what comparison should we compare it ? 
8 As to a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown upon the earth , is less than all seeds which are upon the earth , 
9 and when it has been sown , mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs , and produces great branches , so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow . 
10 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it . 
11 But without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples . 
12 And the same day , when the evening was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side . 
13 And when they had sent away the crowd , they took him even as he was in the ship . And there were also with him other small boats . 
14 And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full . 
15 And he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ? 
16 And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . 
17 And he said to them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ? 
18 And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?

1 And when he had thus spoken , he went on before , going up to Jerusalem . 
2 And it came to pass , when he had come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples , 
3 Saying , Go ye into the village over against you : in which at your entering ye will find a colt tied , on which yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him . 
4 And if any one ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say , The Lord hath need of him . 
5 And they that were sent went away , and found even as he had said unto them . 
6 And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ? 
7 And they said , The Lord hath need of him . 
8 And they brought him unto Jesus : and they threw their garments upon the colt , and set Jesus thereon . 
9 And as he went , they spread their garments in the way . 
10 And as he was now drawing nigh , even at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen ; 
11 saying , Blessed ' is ' the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . 
12 And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him , Teacher , rebuke thy disciples . 
13 And he answered and said , I tell you that , if these shall hold their peace , the stones will cry out . 
14 And when he drew nigh , he saw the city and wept over it , 
15 saying , If thou hadst known in this day , even thou , the things which belong unto peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes . 
16 For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and encompass thee , and keep thee in on every side , 
17 and shall dash thee to the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation . 
18 And he entered into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold , 
19 saying unto them , It is written , My house shall be called a house of prayer : but ye make it a den of robbers . 
20 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them . 
21 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the son of David ; they were sore displeased , 
22 And said unto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ? 
23 And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there . 
24 Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered . 
25 And when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . And presently the fig tree withered away . 
26 And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away ! 
27 Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree , but even if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou taken away and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done . 
28 And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . 
29 And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ? 
30 And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things . 
31 The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven or from men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say to us , Why then did ye not believe him ? 
32 But if we shall say , From men ; all the people will stone us : for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . 
33 And they answered , that they knew not whence ' it was ' . 
34 And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things . 
35 And he began to speak unto the people this parable : A man planted a vineyard , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country : 
36 And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it . 
37 And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another . 
38 Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise . 
39 But last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son . 
40 But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours . 
41 And they took him and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard . 
42 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . 
43 Have ye not read even this scripture : The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ; 
44 This was from the Lord , And it is marvellous in our eyes ? 
45 And they sought to lay hold on him ; and they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spake this parable against them . 
46 And they watched him , and sent forth spies , who should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor . 
47 And they asked him , saying , Teacher , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , and acceptest not the person ' of any ' , but of a truth teachest the way of God : 
48 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar , or not ? 
49 But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , 
50 Show me a denarius . Whose image and superscription hath it ? And answering they said , Caesar 's . 
51 And he said to them , Render therefore to Cesar the things which are Cesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . 
52 And they said , Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we have known ? how then does this he say that I am ? 
53 And they answered , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elijah ; and others , One of the prophets . 
54 And he saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ . 
55 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him . 
56 And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , and the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again . 
57 And he spake that saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him . 
58 But he turning about , and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , and saith , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .

1 While While he was yet speaking , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's ' house ' , saying , Thy daughter is dead : trouble not the Teacher . 
2 But Jesus hearing it , answered him , Fear not : only believe , and she shall be made well . 
3 And when he came to the house he suffered no one to go in but Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother . 
4 And all were weeping and lamenting her . But he said , Do not weep , for she has not died , but sleeps . 
5 And they derided him , knowing that she had died . 
6 But * he * , knowing their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house set against a house falls ; 
7 and if also Satan is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub . 
8 And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges . 
9 But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then is the kingdom of God come upon you . 
10 Or how can one enter into the house of the strong ' man , ' and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong ' man ' ? and then he will spoil his house . 
11 He that is not with me is against me , and he that gathers not with me scatters . 
12 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out . 
13 And when he is come , he findeth it swept and garnished . 
14 Then he goeth and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first . 
15 And it came to pass as he spake these things , a certain woman , lifting up her voice out of the crowd , said to him , Blessed is the womb that has borne thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked . 
16 But * he * said , Yea rather , blessed are they who hear the word of God , and keep it . 
17 And when the crowds were gathering together unto him , he began to say , This generation is an evil generation : it seeks a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it but the sign of Jonas . 
18 For even as Jonas became a sign to the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation . 
19 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , more than Solomon [ is ] here . 
20 But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man , he goes through dry places seeking rest ; and not finding [ any ] he says , I will return to my house whence I came out . 
21 And having come , he finds it swept and adorned . 
22 Then he goes and takes seven other spirits worse than himself , and entering in , they dwell there ; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first . Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also . 
23 But while he was yet speaking to the crowds , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him . 
24 Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee . 
25 But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ? 
26 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren ! 
27 For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother .

1 And he said to them , Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? But they held their peace . 
2 And he looked round about on them all , and said unto him , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did ' so ' : and his hand was restored . 
3 But they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus . 
4 And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray , and he spent the night in prayer to God . 
5 And when it was day , he called his disciples ; and he chose from them twelve , whom also he named apostles . 
6 Simon Peter therefore , when he saw that he was sick , and was moved with compassion for her , and said to her , Weep not . 
7 And he came and touched the bier : And they that bore him stood still . And he said , Young man , I say to thee , Arise . 
8 And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he gave him to his mother . 
9 And fear took hold on all : and they glorified God , saying , A great prophet has been raised up amongst us ; and God has visited his people . 
10 And this report went out in all Judaea concerning him , and in all the surrounding country . 
11 And the disciples of John informed him of all these things . 
12 And John calling two of his disciples sent them to Jesus , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ? 
13 And the same hour , when the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus , so that they might put him to death ; 
14 But they found not the saying , and feared to ask him . 
15 And he came unto Capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ? 
16 But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest . 
17 And he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all . 
18 And he took a little child , and set him in the midst of them : and taking him in his arms , he said unto them , 
19 Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name , receiveth me : and whoever receiveth me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me . 
20 John said unto him , Teacher , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followed not us . 
21 But Jesus said , Forbid him not : for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me . 
22 For he that is not against us , is on our part . 
23 For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward . 
24 And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me , to fall into sin , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea . 
25 And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having thy two hands to go away into hell , into the fire unquenchable ; 
26 [ where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched ] . 
27 And if thy foot causeth thee to fall into sin , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life lame , than having thy two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched : 
28 Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . 
29 And if thy foot causeth thee to fall into sin , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having thy two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire unquenchable ; 
30 [ where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched ] . 
31 And if thy foot cause thee to stumble , cut it off : it is good for thee to enter into life maimed , rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell . 
32 where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . 
33 For every one shall be salted with fire . 
34 Salt is good : but if the salt have lost its saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace one with another .

1 And another were taken , and having given thanks , he laid [ it ] , and gave [ it ] to them , saying , Drink ye all of it . 
2 For this is my blood , that of the [ new ] covenant , that shed for many for remission of sins . 
3 But I say to you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father 's kingdom . 
4 And when they had sung a hymn , they went out unto the mount of Olives . 
5 Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered . 
6 But after that I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee . 
7 But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I. 
8 And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that thou to - day , ' even ' this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . 
9 But he spake the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all . 
10 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray . 
11 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be greatly amazed , and sore troubled . 
12 And he saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch . 
13 And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , If it were possible , the hour might pass from him . 
14 And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt . 
15 And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldst not thou watch one hour ? 
16 Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak . 
17 And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words . 
18 And when he cometh , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him . 
19 And he cometh the third time , and saith to them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . 
20 Arise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that betrayeth me . 
21 And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders . 
22 Now he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely . 
23 And as soon as he was come , he goeth immediately to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him . 
24 And they laid their hands on him , and took him . 
25 And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear . 
26 And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ? 
27 I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled . 
28 And they all forsook him , and fled . 
29 And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him : 
30 And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked . 
31 And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes . 
32 And Peter followed him at a distance , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire . 
33 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none . 
34 For many bare false witness against him , but their testimony agreed not together . 
35 And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying , 
36 We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands . 
37 But neither so did their testimony agree together . 
38 And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ? 
39 But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ , the Son of God . 
40 Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say to you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven . 
41 Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy : what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard the blasphemy . 
42 What think ye ? They answered and said , He is guilty of death . 
43 Then did they spit in his face and buffet him : and some smote him with the palms of their hands , 
44 saying , Prophesy to us , Christ , who is it that struck thee ? 
45 And Peter sat without in the palace : and a maid came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean . 
46 But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest . 
47 And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth . 
48 And again he denied with an oath , I know not the man . 
49 And after a little while , another saw him , and said , Thou also art ' one ' of them . But Peter said , Man , I am not . 
50 And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it , saying , In truth this [ man ] also was with him , for also he is a Galilaean . 
51 And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he was yet speaking , the cock crowed . 
52 And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how that he said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . 
53 And Peter went out , and wept bitterly . 
54 And the men that held Jesus , mocked him , and smote him . 
55 And when they had blindfolded him on the face , they said to him , Rabbi , carest thou not that we perish ? 
56 And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . 
57 And he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ? 
58 And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?

10

1 And when he had said this , she went away and called her sister Mary secretly , saying , The teacher is come and calls thee . 
2 And she , when she heard it , arose quickly , and went unto him . 
3 Now Jesus had not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him . 
4 The Jews then who were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary that she rose hastily , and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth to the grave to weep there . 
5 Then when Mary had come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . 
6 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled . 
7 And said , Where have ye laid him ? They say to him , Lord , come and see . 
8 Jesus wept . 
9 The Jews therefore said , Behold how he loved him ! 
10 And some of them said , Could not this man , who opened the eyes of him that was blind , have caused that this man also should not die ? 
11 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it . 
12 Jesus saith , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time the body decayeth ; for he hath been ' dead ' four days . 
13 Jesus saith to her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou believedst , thou shouldest see the glory of God ? 
14 So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me : 
15 And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the multitude that stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou didst send me . 
16 And when he had thus spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth . 
17 And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go . 
18 Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and beheld what he done , believed on him ; 
19 but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done . 
20 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles . 
21 If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . 
22 But a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said to them , Ye know nothing at all , 
23 Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not . 
24 And this he spoke not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ; 
25 And not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad . 
26 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death . 
27 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence to a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples . 
28 And the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves . 
29 Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ? 
30 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he was , he should show it , that they might take him .

11

1 In that was the Word said to the prophets , [ It is ] not the prophet that has come into the world . 
2 And when he had come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith to them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said unto him , Yea , Lord . 
3 Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it done unto you . 
4 And their eyes were opened . And Jesus strictly charged them , saying , See that no man know it . 
5 But they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country . 
6 As they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil . 
7 And when the demon was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel . 
8 But the Pharisees said , By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons . 
9 And he called them unto him , and said to them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ? 
10 And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand . 
11 And if a house be divided against itself , that house can not stand . 
12 And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he can not stand , but hath an end . 
13 No man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house . 
14 Verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men , and any blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme ; 
15 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never hath forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation : 
16 Because they said , He hath an unclean spirit . 
17 And there come his mother and his brethren ; and , standing without , they sent unto him , calling him . 
18 And the multitude sat about him , and they said to him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee . 
19 And he answereth them , and saith unto them , What is this that is written , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner - stone ? 
20 Every one falling on this stone shall be broken , but on whomsoever it shall fall , it shall grind him to powder . 
21 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them . 
22 And they watched him , and sent forth spies , who feigned themselves to be righteous , that they might take hold of his speech , so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor . 
23 And they asked him , saying , Teacher , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , and acceptest not the person ' of any ' , but of a truth teachest the way of God : 
24 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar , or not ? 
25 But he perceived their craftiness , and said to them , Why tempt ye me ? 
26 Show me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered and said , Cesar 's . 
27 And he said to them , Pay therefore what is Caesar 's to Caesar , and what is God 's to God . 
28 And they laid their hands upon him , and took him . 
29 And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear . 
30 And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staffs to take me ? 
31 I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled . 
32 And they all forsook him , and fled . 
33 And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him : 
34 And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked . 
35 And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes . 
36 And Peter followed him at a distance , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire . 
37 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none . 
38 For many bore false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together . 
39 And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying , 
40 We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands . 
41 And not even so did their witness agree together . 
42 And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ? 
43 But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and said to him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? 
44 And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven . 
45 Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ? 
46 Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death . 
47 And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands . 
48 And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest : 
49 And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth . 
50 But he denied , saying , I know not , neither do I understand what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew . 
51 And the maid saw him , and began to say to those that stood by , This is one of them . 
52 And he denied it again . And a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto . 
53 But he began to curse and to swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak . 
54 And the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him , Before the cock shall crow twice , thou wilt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept .

1 Ye have heard that it was said , Thou shalt not commit adultery . 
2 But * I * say unto you , that every one who is angry with his brother shall be subject to the judgment ; but whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council ; and whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of the hell of fire . 
3 If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar , and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee , 
4 leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way , first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift . 
5 Agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison . 
6 Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the very last mite .

1 Hosanna in the highest , as it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ) , 
2 and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtle - doves , or two young pigeons . 
3 And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Spirit was upon him . 
4 And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ . 
5 And he came in the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law , 
6 Then he took him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said , 
7 Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word : 
8 For my eyes have seen thy salvation , 
9 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ; 
10 A light to enlighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel . 
11 And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him . 
12 And Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which is spoken against ; 
13 ( and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul ; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed . 
14 And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher : she was of a great age , and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity , 
15 and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years ) , who departed not from the temple , worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day . 
16 And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God , and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem . 
17 And when they had accomplished all things according to the law of [ the ] Lord , they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth . 
18 And the child grew and waxed strong [ in spirit ] , filled with wisdom , and God 's grace was upon him . 
19 And his parents went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover . 
20 And when he was twelve years old , they went up after the custom of the feast . 
21 But when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and his parents knew it not ; 
22 but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day 's journey ; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance : 
23 and when they found him not , they returned to Jerusalem , seeking him . 
24 And it came to pass , as they were in perplexity about it , that behold , two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment . 
25 And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground , they said to them , Why seek ye the living one among the dead ? 
26 He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee , 
27 saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again . 
28 And they remembered his words , 
29 and returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest . 
30 It was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women with them , who told these things to the apostles . 
31 And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale , and they disbelieved them . 
32 But Peter , rising up , ran to the sepulchre , and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone , and went away home , wondering at what had happened . 
33 And behold , two of them were going on during that day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem , called Emmaus ; 
34 and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place . 
35 And it came to pass , as they were parting from the colt , his mother was there , and had come to the house of the Lord . 
36 And when the days of his ministration were fulfilled , the governor of the Jews came to him , saying , 
37 Where wilt thou that we shall prepare for thee ? And , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be when they see him they will reverence him . 
38 But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance . 
39 And they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him . 
40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh , what will he do to those husbandmen ? 
41 They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those evil [ men ] , and let out the vineyard to other husbandmen , who shall render him the fruits in their seasons . 
42 Jesus says to them , Have ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , The same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord 's doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ? 
43 Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you , and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof . 
44 And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken , but on whomsoever it shall fall , it shall grind him to powder . 
45 And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour to lay hands on him , and they feared the people ; for they knew that he had spoken this parable against them . 
46 And they watched him , and sent forth spies , who should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor . 
47 And they asked him saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , and acceptest no [ man 's ] person , but teachest with truth the way of God : 
48 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar , or not ? 
49 But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? Bring me a denarius that I may see it . 
50 And they brought it . And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar 's . 
51 And Jesus answering said unto them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . And they marvelled at him . 
52 Then come to him the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying , 
53 Master , Moses wrote unto us , If a man 's brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no child , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . 
54 There were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed . 
55 And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise . 
56 And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also . 
57 In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her for a wife . 
58 And Jesus answering , said to them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ?

14

1 
2 And when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable . 
3 And he said unto them , Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but to them that are without , all these things are done in parables : 
4 That seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest haply they should turn again , and the sins shall be forgiven them . 
5 And he saith to them , Know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ? 
6 The sower soweth the word . 
7 And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts . 
8 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ; 
9 And have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word 's sake , immediately they relapse . 
10 And these are they who are sown among thorns ; such as hear the word , 
11 And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful . 
12 And these are they who have been sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred . 
13 And he said to them , Is a candle brought to be put under a close vessel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ? 
14 For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad . 
15 If any man have ears to hear , let him hear . 
16 And he said to them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and to you that hear shall more be given . 
17 For he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath . 
18 And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ; 
19 And should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how . 
20 The earth beareth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear . 
21 But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come . 
22 And he said , How shall we liken the kingdom of God , or with what comparison should we compare it ? 
23 As to a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown upon the earth , is less than all seeds which are upon the earth , 
24 and when it is sown , groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under its shade . 
25 And with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it . 
26 But without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples . 
27 And the same day , when the even was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side . 
28 And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the boat . And there were also with him other small boats . 
29 And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full . 
30 And he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ? 
31 And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . 
32 And he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ? 
33 And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?

15

1 ' And a second like ' is ' like ' it ' , this it is written , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ; -- greater than these there is no other command . ' 
2 And the scribe said to him , ' Well , Teacher , in truth thou hast spoken that there is one God ; and there is none other but he ; 
3 and to love Him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more than all whole burnt - offerings and sacrifices . ' 
4 And Jesus , having called the child , said , ' It hath been said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me already three days , and have nothing to eat , and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way , 
5 and they were not able to take hold of him in the way , and the sons of the reign , and having been speaking , they were not afraid , 
6 and Peter answering said to him , ' Lo , we have left all , and followed thee ; ' 
7 and he said to them , ' Verily I say to you , there is no one who left house , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or fields , for my sake , and for the good news ' , 
8 who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brothers , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and fields , with persecutions , and in the age that is coming , life age - during ; 
9 and many first shall be last , and the last first . ' 
10 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going before them , and they were amazed , and following they were afraid . And having again taken the twelve , he began to tell them the things about to happen to him , 
11 ' Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests , and to the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the nations to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify , and the third day he will rise again . ' 
12 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , doing homage , and asking something of him , 
13 and he said to her , ' What wilt thou ? ' She saith to him , ' Say , that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy right hand , and one on the left , in thy reign . ' 
14 And Jesus answering said , ' Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves ; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink ? and with the baptism that I am baptized with , to be baptized ? ' They say to him , ' We are able . ' 
15 And he saith to them , ' Of my cup indeed ye shall drink , and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized ; but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared . ' 
16 And the ten having heard , began to be much displeased at James and John , 
17 but Jesus having called them near , said , ' Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not , for of such is the reign of God ; 
18 verily I say to you , whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child , may not enter into it . ' 
19 And a certain ruler questioned him , saying , ' Good teacher , what having done -- shall I inherit life age - during ? ' 
20 And Jesus said to him , ' Why me dost thou call good ? no one ' is ' good except One -- God ; but if thou dost will to enter into the life , keep the commands . ' 
21 He saith to him , ' What kind ? ' And Jesus said , ' Thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness , 
22 honour thy father and mother , and , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . ' 
23 The young man saith to him , ' All these did I keep from my youth ; what yet do I lack ? ' 
24 Jesus said to him , ' If thou dost will to be perfect , go away , sell what thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , be following me ; ' 
25 and he , having heard these things , became very sorrowful , for he was exceeding rich . 
26 And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful , said , ' How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God ! ' 
27 And the disciples were amazed at his words . And Jesus again answering saith to them , ' Children , how hard is it to those trusting on the riches to enter into the reign of God ! 
28 It is easier for a camel through the eye of the needle to enter , than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God . ' 
29 And they were astonished beyond measure , saying unto themselves , ' And who is able to be saved ? ' 
30 And Jesus having turned , and said , ' Verily I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up . ' 
31 And being grieved exceedingly , they began to say to him , each of them , ' Is it I , Sir ? ' 
32 And he answering said , ' He who did dip with me the hand in the dish , he will deliver me up ; 
33 the Son of Man doth indeed go , as it hath been written concerning him , but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up ! good it were for him if that man had not been born . ' 
34 And Judas -- he who delivered him up -- answering said , ' Is it I , Rabbi ? ' He saith , ' I am not . ' 
35 And one of the servants having come near , was asking him , saying , ' Teacher , we wish to see Jesus ; ' 
36 and he , having cast away the multitude , did question him , saying , ' What wilt thou that I may do to thee ? ' and he said , ' Sir , that I may receive sight . ' 
37 And Jesus said to him , ' Receive thy sight ; thy faith hath saved thee ; ' 
38 and immediately he saw , and the Spirit came down from him , and again was a great calm . 
39 And he said to him , ' Rightly thou didst judge ; go , sell whatever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , be following me , having taken up the cross . ' 
40 And he -- gloomy at the word -- went away sorrowing , for he was having many possessions . 
41 And Jesus having looked round , saith to his disciples , ' How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the reign of God ! ' 
42 And the disciples were amazed at his words . And Jesus again answering saith to them , ' Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! 
43 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God . ' 
44 And they were astonished exceedingly , saying unto him , ' And who is able to be saved ? ' 
45 And Jesus having looked upon them , saith , ' With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God . ' 
46 And Peter began to say to him , ' Lo , we left all , and we followed thee . ' 
47 And Jesus answering said , ' Verily I say to you , there is no one who left house , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or fields , for my sake , and for the good news ' , 
48 who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brothers , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and fields , with persecutions , and in the age that is coming , life age - during ; 
49 and many first shall be last , and the last first . ' 
50 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going before them , and they were amazed , and following they were afraid . And having again taken the twelve , he began to tell them the things about to happen to him , 
51 ' Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests , and to the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the nations to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify , and the third day he will rise again . ' 
52 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , doing homage , and asking something of him , 
53 and he said to her , ' What wilt thou ? ' She saith to him , ' Grant , that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy right hand , and one on the left , in thy reign . ' 
54 And Jesus answering said , ' Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves ; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink ? and with the baptism that I am baptized with , to be baptized ? ' They say to him , ' We are able . ' 
55 And he saith to them , ' Of my cup indeed ye shall drink , and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized ; but to sit on my right hand and on my left , is not mine to give , but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared by my father . ' 
56 And the ten having heard , began to be much displeased at James and John , 
57 but Jesus having called them near , saith to them , ' Ye have known that they who are considered to rule the nations do exercise lordship over them , and their great ones do exercise authority upon them ; 
58 but not so shall it be among you ; but whoever may will to become great among you , he shall be your minister ,

1 And if the disciples be gone away , say to the master of the house , The Teacher saith , Where is my guest - chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples ? 
2 And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us . 
3 And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said to them ; and they made ready the passover . 
4 And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve . 
5 And as they sat and were eating , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you shall betray me , ' even ' he that eateth with me . 
6 They began to be sorrowful , and to say to him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ? 
7 And he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish . 
8 The Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written concerning him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born . 
9 And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body . 
10 And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it . 
11 And he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many . 
12 Verily I say to you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God . 
13 And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives . 
14 And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered . 
15 But after that I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee . 
16 But Peter said to him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I. 
17 And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that thou to - day , ' even ' this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . 
18 But he spoke the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all . 
19 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith unto his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray . 
20 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be greatly amazed , and to be very heavy ; 
21 And saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful to death : tarry ye here , and watch . 
22 And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him . 
23 And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt . 
24 And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ? 
25 Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak . 
26 And again he went away , and prayed , and spoke the same words . 
27 And when he returned , he found them asleep again ( for their eyes were heavy ; ) neither knew they what to answer him . 
28 And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough ; the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . 
29 Rise , let us be going : behold , he that delivers me up has drawn nigh . 
30 And immediately , while he was yet speaking , Judas comes up , [ being ] one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and sticks , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders . 
31 Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign between them , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he ; seize him , and lead [ him ] away safely . 
32 And being come , straightway coming up to him , he says , Rabbi , Rabbi ; and he covered him with kisses . 
33 And they laid their hands on him , and took him . 
34 But one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear . 
35 Then saith Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into its place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword . 
36 Or thinkest thou that I can not now call upon my Father , and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels ? 
37 How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be ? 
38 In that hour Jesus said to the crowds , Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me ? I sat daily [ with you ] teaching in the temple , and ye did not seize me . 
39 But all this is come to pass , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples left him , and fled . 
40 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together . 
41 But Peter followed him at a distance , even unto the palace of the high priest , and entering in sat with the officers , to see the end . 
42 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus , that they might put him to death ; 
43 and they found it not , though many false witnesses came . But afterward came two , 
44 and said , This man said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days . 
45 And the high priest stood up , and said unto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ? 
46 But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ , the Son of God . 
47 Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven . 
48 Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ? 
49 Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death . 
50 And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands . 
51 And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest : 
52 And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth . 
53 But he denied , saying , I know not , neither understand I what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew . 
54 And the maid saw him , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them . 
55 And he denied it again . And a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto . 
56 But he began to curse and to swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak . 
57 And the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept .

17

1 And Peter said to him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . 
2 But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and leave the dead to bury their own dead . 
3 And when he had gone into the boat , his disciples followed him . 
4 And behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep . 
5 And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Save , Lord ; we perish . 
6 And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm . 
7 But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ? 
8 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with demons , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way . 
9 And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ? 
10 And there was also a inscription among them , which of them should be accounted to be greatest . 
11 And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors . 
12 But ye ' shall ' not ' be ' so : but he that is greater among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve . 
13 For which is greater , he that sitteth at table , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at table ? but I am among you as he that serveth . 
14 Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations . 
15 And I appoint to you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed to me ; 
16 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . 
17 And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan has desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat : 
18 But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not ; and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren . 
19 And he said to him , Lord , with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death . 
20 And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me . 
21 And he said to them , When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals , did ye lack anything ? And they said , Nothing . 
22 He said therefore to them , But now he that has a purse let him take [ it ] , and likewise , having a wallet , and he lay away his cloak . 
23 And he that falleth on the rocky places , that he that is not the shepherd , but the shepherd are the light of the sheep , but the wolf catcheth them . 
24 Wherefore he is a servant of the world , but of the earth ; he that followeth the word is not above the word . 
25 ' How can the man say that I am ? 
26 If I love them , ye shall not believe : and if I do , that ye shall believe that I am [ he ] . 
27 And they said to him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou that prophet ? And he answered , No . 
28 Then said they to him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ? 
29 He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said Isaiah the prophet . 
30 And they had been sent from the Pharisees . 
31 And they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ? 
32 John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ; 
33 He it is , who coming after me , is preferred before me , whose shoes ' latchet I am not worthy to unloose . 
34 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing . 
35 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world . 
36 This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me . 
37 And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water . 
38 And John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him . 
39 And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said to me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him , the same is he who baptizeth with the Holy Spirit . 
40 And I saw , and bare record that this is the Son of God . 
41 Again , on the morrow , there stood John and two of his disciples . 
42 And , looking at Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God ! 
43 And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus . 
44 Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? They said unto him , Rabbi ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master ) , where dwellest thou ? 
45 He saith unto them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour . 
46 One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother . 
47 He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith to him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ . 
48 And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone . 
49 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith to him , follow me . 
50 Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter . 
51 Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . 
52 And Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see . 
53 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile ! 
54 Nathanael saith to him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig - tree , I saw thee . 
55 Nathanael answered and said to him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God , thou art the King of Israel . 
56 Jesus answered and said to him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig - tree , believest thou ? Thou shalt see greater things than these . 
57 And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .

18

1 And Jesus answering , said unto them , Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard : the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the poor have good tidings preached to them . 
2 And blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me . 
3 And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to behold ? a reed shaken with the wind ? 
4 But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in delicate raiment ? Behold , those who are in splendid clothing and live luxuriously are in the courts of kings . 
5 But what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and much more than a prophet . 
6 This is he , concerning whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way before thee . 
7 Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John : yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he . 
8 And from the days of John the Baptist until now , the kingdom of heaven is forcing , that every man should be manifested into the world . 
9 And he spoke the parable unto them , The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath . 
10 And it came to pass on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man there , and his right hand was withered . 
11 And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath ; that they might find how to accuse him . 
12 But he knew their thoughts . And he took the blind man and by him , and saith unto him , Prophesy : thou art the King of the Jews . 
13 But he answered him , Who is it that I hear this of thee ? give the account of thy stewardship : for thou mayest be no longer steward . 
14 And the steward said within himself , What shall I do , because my lord is taking the stewardship from me ? I am not able to dig ; to beg I am ashamed . 
15 And I know what I will do , that when I am removed from the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses . 
16 So he called his disciples to [ him ] , and said to them , Hear , and understand : 
17 Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man ; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth , this defileth the man . 
18 Then came the disciples , and said to him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , when they heard this saying ? 
19 But he answered and said , Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not , shall be rooted up . 
20 Let them alone : they are blind guides . And if the blind guide the blind , both shall fall into a pit . 
21 The disciple is not above his teacher , but every one that is perfected shall be as his teacher . 
22 But why lookest thou on the mote that is in the eye of thy brother , but observest not the beam that is in thine eye ? 
23 Or how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother 's eye . 
24 For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit ; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit . 
25 For each tree is known by its own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes . 
26 The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and the evil ' man ' out of the evil ' treasure ' bringeth forth that which is evil : for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh . 
27 And why call ye me Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? 
28 Every one that comes unto me , and heareth my words , and doeth them , I will show you to whom he is like . 
29 He is like a man who built a house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock ; and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock . 
30 But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that , without a foundation , built a house on the earth , against which the stream beat vehemently , and immediately it fell , and the breach of that house was great .

19

1 And And it came to pass , that , while he was in one of the cities , that behold , there was a man full of leprosy , and seeing Jesus , falling upon his face , he besought him saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou art able to cleanse me . 
2 And he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou made clean . And straightway the leprosy departed from him . 
3 And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded for a testimony to them . 
4 But so much the more a fame of him went abroad : and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities . 
5 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed . 
6 And it came to pass on one of those days , that he was teaching , and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and [ out of ] Jerusalem ; and [ the ] Lord 's power was [ there ] to heal them . 
7 And behold , men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed ; and they sought to bring him in , and to lay him before him . 
8 And not finding by what ' way ' they might bring him in because of the multitude , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay . 
9 When Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins be forgiven thee . 
10 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts , 
11 Why doth this man thus speak ? he blasphemeth : who can forgive sins but one , ' even ' God ? 
12 And Jesus said , Some one did touch me ; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me . 
13 And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him , and how she was healed immediately . 
14 And he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace . 
15 While he was yet speaking , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's ' house ' , saying , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ? 
16 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith to the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe . 
17 And he suffered no one to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James . 
18 And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue ; and he beholdeth a tumult , and ' many ' weeping and wailing greatly . 
19 And when he was entered in , he saith unto them , Why make ye a tumult , and weep ? the child is not dead , but sleepeth . 
20 And they laughed him to scorn . But when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying . 
21 And he took the damsel by the hand , and said unto her , Talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , Damsel , I say unto thee , Arise . 
22 And straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment . 
23 And he charged them strictly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .

20

1 And Jesus , having sat down over , they took the twelve clothes , and fled , and filled with them , that he might take them from the goats . 
2 And he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude . 
3 And they ate , and were all satisfied : and there was taken up of what had remained over and above to them in fragments twelve hand - baskets . 
4 And they were filled with madness , and were satisfied with them ; 
5 and they said unto them , What are ye doing , loosing the colt ? 
6 And they said to them as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go . 
7 And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him . 
8 And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off trees , and strewed them in the way . 
9 And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord : 
10 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest . 
11 And when he was come into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ? 
12 And the multitudes said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee . 
13 And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money - changers and the seats of those that sold the doves . 
14 And he saith to them , It is written , My house shall be called a house of prayer : but ye make it a den of robbers . 
15 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them . 
16 And when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders which he wrought , and the children crying in the temple and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David , they were indignant , 
17 and said to him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus says unto them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ? 
18 And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there . 
19 Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered . 
20 And when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . And presently the fig tree withered away . 
21 And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away ! 
22 Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree , but even if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou taken up and cast into the sea , it shall be done . 
23 And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . 
24 And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ? 
25 And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things . 
26 The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven or from men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ? 
27 But if we shall say , From men ; all the people will stone us : for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . 
28 And they answered , that they knew not whence ' it was ' . 
29 And Jesus said to them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things . 
30 And he began to speak unto the people this parable : A man planted a vineyard , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into another country for a long time . 
31 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard . 
32 And they took him , and beat him , and sent him away empty . 
33 And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled . 
34 And again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some . 
35 Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son . 
36 But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours . 
37 And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard . 
38 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . 
39 Have ye not even read this scripture , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner - stone : 
40 this is of the Lord , and it is wonderful in our eyes ? 
41 And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people ; for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way . 
42 And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , to catch him in his words . 
43 And when they had come , they say to him , Master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of God in truth : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ? 
44 Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it . 
45 And they brought it . And he saith to them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar 's . 
46 And Jesus answering said to them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . And they marvelled at him . 
47 Then come to him the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying , 
48 Master , Moses wrote unto us , If a man 's brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . 
49 Now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed . 
50 And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise . 
51 And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also . 
52 In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her for a wife . 
53 And Jesus answering , said to them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ? 
54 For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels who are in heaven . 
55 And as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? 
56 He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err . 
57 And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ? 
58 And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord .

21

1 And the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people were gathered together to him , 
2 and saying to him , See , thy disciples and that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath . 
3 But he said unto them , Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry , and they that were with him ; 
4 how he entered into the house of God , and ate the showbread , which it was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them that were with him , but only for the priests ? 
5 Or have ye not read in the law , how on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ? 
6 But I say unto you , that one greater than the temple is here . 
7 But if ye had known what this meaneth , I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless . 
8 For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath . 
9 And , going away from thence , he came into Galilee ; 
10 and leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim : 
11 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet , saying , 
12 The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles , 
13 The people that sat in darkness Saw a great light , And to those sitting in the region and shadow of death -- light arose to them . 
14 From that time began Jesus to preach and to say , Repent , for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh . 
15 And walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon , whose other name was Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers . 
16 And he saith unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men . 
17 And straightway they left the nets , and followed him . 
18 And going on thence he saw other two brethren , James the [ son ] of Zebedee and John his brother , in the ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them . 
19 And they straightway left the boat and their father , and followed him . 
20 And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people . 
21 And his fame went throughout all Syria : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with demons , and those which were lunatick , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them . 
22 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and ' from ' beyond the Jordan .

22

1 And Jesus went into the temple and taught . 
2 And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him . 
3 And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ? 
4 And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away . 
5 And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept . 
6 But from the beginning of the creation , God made them male and female . 
7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ; 
8 And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more two , but one flesh . 
9 What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . 
10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter . 
11 And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her . 
12 And if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery . 
13 And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them . 
14 But when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God . 
15 Verily I say to you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein . 
16 And he took them in his arms , and blessed them , laying his hands upon them . 
17 And as he was going forth into the way , there ran one to him , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? 
18 And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , ' even ' God . 
19 Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother . 
20 And he said , All these things have I kept from my youth up . 
21 And when Jesus heard it , he said unto him , One thing thou lackest yet : sell all that thou hast , and distribute to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . 
22 But when the young man heard the saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions . 
23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven . 
24 And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . 
25 And they that heard it , said , Who then can be saved ? 
26 But Jesus , looking on them , said , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for all things are possible with God . 
27 Peter began to say unto him , Lo , * we * have left all things and have followed thee . 
28 Jesus answered and said to them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel 's , 
29 But he shall receive an hundred - fold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life . 
30 But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first . 
31 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him , 
32 Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles : 
33 And they shall mock him , and shall spit upon him , and shall scourge him , and shall kill him ; and after three days he shall rise again . 
34 And there come near to him James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying unto him , Teacher , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire . 
35 And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ? 
36 They said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory . 
37 But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? 
38 And they said unto him , We are able . And Jesus said unto them , The cup that I drink ye shall drink ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized : 
39 but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give , but for those for whom it is prepared . 
40 And the ten having heard [ of it ] , began to be indignant about James and John . 
41 But Jesus having called them to [ him ] , says to them , Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them . 
42 But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister ; 
43 and whosoever would be first of you shall be bondman of all . 
44 For also the Son of man did not come to be ministered to , but to minister , and give his life a ransom for many . 
45 And they come to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging . 
46 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me . 
47 And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me . 
48 And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee . 
49 And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus . 
50 And Jesus answered and said to him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? The blind man said unto him , Lord , that I might receive my sight . 
51 And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .

23

1 And But the eleven disciples went into Galilee , to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them . 
2 And when they saw him , they worshipped him : but some doubted . 
3 And Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power hath been given me in heaven and upon earth . 
4 Go [ therefore ] and make disciples of all the nations , baptising them to the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit ; 
5 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world .

24

1 And they came to the sea , and found the eleven men , and they give them a sign , saying , ' Sir , save me . ' 
2 And he answering said , ' It is not good to take the children 's bread , and to cast to the little dogs . ' 
3 And she said , ' Yes , sir , for even the little dogs do eat of the crumbs that are falling from their lords ' table ; ' 
4 then answering , Jesus said to her , ' O woman , great ' is ' thy faith , let it be to thee as thou wilt ; ' and her daughter was healed from that hour . 
5 And Jesus having passed over , came nigh unto the sea of Galilee , and having gone up to the mountain , he was sitting there , and there was there with him a great multitude , 
6 and they were astonished at his teaching , because his word was with authority . 
7 And in the synagogue was a man , having a spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a great voice , 
8 saying , ' Away , what -- to us and to thee , Jesus , O Nazarene ? thou didst come to destroy us ; I have known thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God . ' 
9 And Jesus rebuked him , saying , ' Be silenced , and come forth out of him , ' 
10 and the unclean spirit having torn him , and having cried with a great voice , came forth out of him , 
11 and they were all amazed , so as to reason among themselves , saying , ' What is this ? what new teaching ' is ' this ? that with authority also the unclean spirits he commandeth , and they obey him ! ' 
12 And Jesus having called them near , said , ' Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not , for of such is the reign of God ; 
13 verily I say to you , whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child , may not enter into it . ' 
14 And a certain ruler questioned him , saying , ' Good teacher , what having done , shall I inherit life age - during ? ' 
15 And Jesus said to him , ' Why me dost thou call good ? no one ' is ' good except One -- God ; but if thou dost will to enter into life , keep the commands . ' 
16 He saith to him again , ' What is truth ? ' and he said to him , ' Because I said to thee , thou wast altogether -- a cock - block , and thou shalt be called Cephas ; because thou didst not believe with me , but on whomsoever I did not keep the morsel . ' 
17 He saith to him , ' What kind ? ' And Jesus said , ' Thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness , 
18 honour thy father and mother ; and , He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death ; 
19 but ye say , If a man may say to father or to mother , Korban ( that is , a gift ) , ' is ' whatever thou mayest be profited out of mine , 
20 and no more do ye suffer him to do anything for his father or for his mother ; 
21 making void the word of God by your tradition , which ye have delivered ; and many such like things ye do . ' 
22 And having called near the multitude , he said to them , ' Hear me , all those things that I did ; ' 
23 and they said to him , ' We have not known , and Jesus answering said to them , ' I am ' he ' , and they went away , and fell to the ground . 
24 ' And , having come near , he awoke them , saying , ' What do ye think ? ' 
25 they said to him , ' Jesus of Nazareth , who is a sinner -- and the prophets -- and the prophets ; ' and they were offended at him . 
26 And he said to them , ' A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own kindred , and in his own house ; ' 
27 and he was not able there any mighty work to do , except that he might be delivered him up to the multitude , 
28 and they having come to the house , the demoniac , and having seen him , he was much displeased , 
29 and having seen a certain fig - tree on the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and he saith to it , ' No more from thee may fruit be -- to the age ; ' and forthwith the fig - tree withered . 
30 And the disciples having seen , did wonder , saying , ' How did the fig - tree forthwith wither ? ' 
31 And Jesus answering said to them , ' Verily I say to you , If ye may have faith , and may not doubt , not only this of the fig - tree shall ye do , but also if ye may say to this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done to you that the Son of Man shall be glorified in the hands of the sinful . 
32 ' And , then , if they may go away to the house , the chief priests and the Pharisees do come , and may find to him who is in the reign of God . 
33 ' And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck , in those days ; for there shall be great distress on the land , and wrath on this people ; 
34 and they shall fall by the mouth of the sword , and shall be led captive to all the nations , and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the nations , until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled . 
35 ' And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars , and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ; 
36 men fainting for the sheep , and for expectation of the things that are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken . 
37 ' And then they shall see the Son of Man , coming in a cloud , with power and much glory ; 
38 and these things beginning to happen bend yourselves back , and lift up your heads , because your redemption doth draw nigh . ' 
39 And he spake a simile to them : ' See the fig - tree , and all the trees ; 
40 when they may now cast forth , having seen , ye know that summer is nigh , the first - good , and he doth nourish the soul , and the piece that he is not able , 
41 for to everyone who is sitting in the field , let him not turn back to take his garments . 
42 ' And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck , in those days ; 
43 and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter , nor on a sabbath ; 
44 for there shall be then great tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the world till now , no , nor may be . 
45 And if those days were not shortened , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shortened . ' 
46 And if any one may say to you , Lo , here ' is ' the Christ , or here , believe ' it ' not , 
47 for there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and they shall give great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , also the chosen . 
48 ' Lo , I did tell you beforehand . 
49 ' If therefore they may say to you , Lo , in the wilderness he is , ye may not go forth ; lo , in the inner chambers , ye may not believe ; 
50 for as the lightning doth come forth from the east , and doth appear to the west , so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man ; 
51 for wherever the carcase may be , there shall the eagles be gathered together . 
52 ' And immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from the heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken ; 
53 and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven ; and then shall all the tribes of the earth smite the breast , and they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of the heaven , with power and much glory ; 
54 and he shall send his messengers with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds , from the ends of the earth unto the ends thereof . 
55 ' And from the fig - tree learn ye the simile : When already its branch may have become tender , and the leaves it may put forth , ye know that summer ' is ' nigh , 
56 so also ye , when ye may see all these , ye know that it is nigh -- at the doors . 
57 Verily I say to you , this generation may not pass away till all these may come to pass . 
58 The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
