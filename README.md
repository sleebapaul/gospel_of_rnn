# Language modelling using PyTorch

### Folders

- char_rnn

It contains the character level language modelling in tinyshakespheare dataset using Recurrent Neural Networks implemented with PyTorch. The data set and a well commented jupyter notebook is added in this folder. The jupyter notebook is orignally a Google Colab notebook. If you find it difficult to reproduce the results locally, try it on Googl Colaboratory. Anyway you can find the original work at [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12pEy-aOS0_PiVkFgxyINmBbtuvB5TqV5/view?usp=sharing). This is planned as a programming session for this blog post in my personal blog. There are a bunch of sample folders are added in this folder where you can find the performance of the network at different hyper parameter settings. Each folder will contain a generated text file, a loss vs iterations graph and the saved trained model which can be reused using PyTorch.

Happy Learning !
