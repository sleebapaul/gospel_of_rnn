<SOC> <SOV> As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us , <EOV> <SOV> As they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word , <EOV> <SOV> It seemed good to me , having made observation , with great care , of the direction of events in their order , to put the facts in writing for you , most noble Theophilus ; <EOV> <SOV> So that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching . <EOV> <SOV> In the days of Herod , king of Judaea , there was a certain priest , by name Zacharias , of the order of Abijah ; and he had a wife of the family of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> They were upright in the eyes of God , keeping all the rules and orders of God , and doing no wrong . <EOV> <SOV> And they were without children , because Elisabeth had never given birth , and they were at that time very old . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before God , <EOV> <SOV> And as was the way of the priests , he had to go into the Temple to see to the burning of perfumes . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people were offering prayers outside , at the time of the burning of perfumes . <EOV> <SOV> And he saw an angel of the Lord in his place on the right side of the altar . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him , and fear came on him . <EOV> <SOV> But the angel said , Have no fear , Zacharias , for your prayer has come to the ears of God , and your wife Elisabeth will have a son , and his name will be John . <EOV> <SOV> And you will be glad and have great delight ; and numbers of people will have joy at his birth . <EOV> <SOV> For he will be great in the eyes of the Lord ; he will not take wine or strong drink ; and he will be full of the Spirit of God from his birth . <EOV> <SOV> And through him great numbers of the children of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God . <EOV> <SOV> And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah , turning the hearts of fathers to their children , and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness ; to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias said to the angel , How may I be certain of this ? For I am an old man , and my wife is far on in years . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel , answering , said , I am Gabriel , whose place is before God ; I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news . <EOV> <SOV> Now , see , you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about , because you had not faith in my words , which will have effect at the right time . <EOV> <SOV> And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came out he was not able to say anything , and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple ; and he was making signs to them without words . <EOV> <SOV> And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended , he went back to his house . <EOV> <SOV> After that time , Elisabeth , being certain that she was to become a mother , kept herself from men 's eyes for five months , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The Lord has done this to me , for his eyes were on me , to take away my shame in the eyes of men . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee , named Nazareth , <EOV> <SOV> To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph , of the family of David ; and the name of the virgin was Mary . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel came in to her and said , Peace be with you , to whom special grace has been given ; the Lord is with you . <EOV> <SOV> But she was greatly troubled at his words , and said to herself , What may be the purpose of these words ? <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said to her , Have no fear , Mary , for you have God 's approval . <EOV> <SOV> And see , you will give birth to a son , and his name will be Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> He will be great , and will be named the Son of the Most High : and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David , his father : <EOV> <SOV> He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever , and of his kingdom there will be no end . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said to the angel , How may this be , because I have had no knowledge of a man ? <EOV> <SOV> And the angel in answer said to her , The Holy Spirit will come on you , and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you , and so that which will come to birth will be named holy , Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Even now Elisabeth , who is of your family , is to be a mother , though she is old : and this is the sixth month with her who was without children . <EOV> <SOV> For there is nothing which God is not able to do . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said : I am the servant of the Lord ; may it be to me as you say . And the angel went away . <EOV> <SOV> Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands , to a town of Judah ; <EOV> <SOV> And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms . <EOV> <SOV> And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth , the baby made a sudden move inside her ; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit , <EOV> <SOV> And she said with a loud voice : May blessing be on you among women , and a blessing on the child of your body . <EOV> <SOV> How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me ? <EOV> <SOV> For , truly , when the sound of your voice came to my ears , the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy . <EOV> <SOV> Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said : My soul gives glory to God ; <EOV> <SOV> My spirit is glad in God my Saviour . <EOV> <SOV> For he has had pity on his servant , though she is poor and lowly placed : and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me . <EOV> <SOV> For he who is strong has done great things for me ; and holy is his name . <EOV> <SOV> His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him . <EOV> <SOV> With his arm he has done acts of power ; he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts . <EOV> <SOV> He has put down kings from their seats , lifting up on high the men of low degree . <EOV> <SOV> Those who had no food he made full of good things ; the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands ; <EOV> <SOV> His help he has given to Israel , his servant , so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever , <EOV> <SOV> As he gave his word to our fathers . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house . <EOV> <SOV> Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth , and she had a son . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her , and they took part in her joy . <EOV> <SOV> And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child , and they would have given him the name of Zacharias , his father 's name ; <EOV> <SOV> But his mother made answer and said , No , his name is John . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Not one of your relations has that name . <EOV> <SOV> And they made signs to his father , to say what name was to be given to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent for writing materials and put down : His name is John ; and they were all surprised . <EOV> <SOV> And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God . <EOV> <SOV> And fear came on all those who were living round about them : and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill - country of Judaea . <EOV> <SOV> And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said , What will this child be ? For the hand of the Lord was with him . <EOV> <SOV> And his father , Zacharias , was full of the Holy Spirit , and with the voice of a prophet said these words : <EOV> <SOV> Praise be to the Lord , the God of Israel , for he has come to his people and made them free , <EOV> <SOV> Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David , <EOV> <SOV> ( As he said , by the mouth of his holy prophets , from the earliest times , ) <EOV> <SOV> Salvation from those who are against us , and from the hands of those who have hate for us ; <EOV> <SOV> To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word , <EOV> <SOV> The oath which he made to Abraham , our father , <EOV> <SOV> That we , being made free from the fear of those who are against us , might give him worship , <EOV> <SOV> In righteousness and holy living before him all our days . <EOV> <SOV> And you , child , will be named the prophet of the Most High : you will go before the face of the Lord , to make ready his ways ; <EOV> <SOV> To give knowledge of salvation to his people , through the forgiveness of sins , <EOV> <SOV> Because of the loving mercies of our God , by which the dawn from heaven has come to us , <EOV> <SOV> To give light to those in dark places , and in the shade of death , so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace . <EOV> <SOV> And the child became tall , and strong in spirit ; and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now it came about in those days that an order went out from Caesar Augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world . <EOV> <SOV> This was the first numbering , which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria . <EOV> <SOV> And all men went to be numbered , everyone to his town . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph went up from Galilee , out of the town of Nazareth , into Judaea , to Beth - lehem , the town of David , because he was of the house and family of David , <EOV> <SOV> To be put on the list with Mary , his future wife , who was about to become a mother . <EOV> <SOV> And while they were there , the time came for her to give birth . <EOV> <SOV> And she had her first son ; and folding him in linen , she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food , because there was no room for them in the house . <EOV> <SOV> And in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields , watching over their flock by night . <EOV> <SOV> And an angel of the Lord came to them , and the glory of the Lord was shining round about them : and fear came on them . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said , Have no fear ; for truly , I give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people : <EOV> <SOV> For on this day , in the town of David , a Saviour has come to birth , who is Christ the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the sign to you : you will see a young child folded in linen , in the place where the cattle have their food . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven , giving praise to God , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Glory to God in the highest , and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven , the keepers of the sheep said to one another , Let us go now to Beth - lehem , and see this thing which has come about , which the Lord has made clear to us . <EOV> <SOV> And they came quickly , and saw Mary and Joseph , and the child in the place where the cattle had their food . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw it , they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child . <EOV> <SOV> And all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary kept all these words in her heart , and gave much thought to them . <EOV> <SOV> Then the keepers of the sheep went back , giving glory and praise to God for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen , as it had been said to them . <EOV> <SOV> And when , after eight days , the time came for his circumcision , he was named Jesus , the name which the angel had given to him before his birth . <EOV> <SOV> And when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of Moses had come to an end , they took him to Jerusalem to give him to the Lord <EOV> <SOV> ( As it says in the law of the Lord , Every mother 's first male child is to be holy to the Lord ) , <EOV> <SOV> And to make an offering , as it is ordered in the law of the Lord , of two doves or other young birds . <EOV> <SOV> And there was then in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon ; and he was an upright man , fearing God and waiting for the comfort of Israel : and the Holy Spirit was on him . <EOV> <SOV> And he had knowledge , through the Holy Spirit , that he would not see death till he had seen the Lord 's Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And full of the Spirit he came into the Temple ; and when the father and mother came in with the child Jesus , to do with him what was ordered by the law , <EOV> <SOV> Then he took him in his arms and gave praise to God and said , <EOV> <SOV> Now you are letting your servant go in peace , O Lord , as you have said ; <EOV> <SOV> For my eyes have seen your salvation , <EOV> <SOV> Which you have made ready before the face of all nations ; <EOV> <SOV> A light of revelation to the Gentiles , and the glory of your people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him . <EOV> <SOV> And Simeon gave them his blessing and said to Mary , his mother , See , this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in Israel , and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said ; <EOV> <SOV> ( And a sword will go through your heart ; ) so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light . <EOV> <SOV> And there was one , Anna , a woman prophet , the daughter of Phanuel , of the family of Asher ( she was very old , and after seven years of married life <EOV> <SOV> She had been a widow for eighty - four years ) ; she was in the Temple at all times , worshipping with prayers and going without food , night and day . <EOV> <SOV> And coming up at that time , she gave praise to God , talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the Lord , they went back to Galilee , to Nazareth , the town where they were living . <EOV> <SOV> And the child became tall and strong and full of wisdom , and the grace of God was on him . <EOV> <SOV> And every year his father and mother went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was twelve years old , they went up , as their way was , to the feast ; <EOV> <SOV> And when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back , the boy Jesus was still in Jerusalem , but they had no knowledge of it : <EOV> <SOV> And in the belief that he was with some of their number , they went a day 's journey ; and after looking for him among their relations and friends , <EOV> <SOV> And seeing that he was not there , they went back to Jerusalem , to make search for him . <EOV> <SOV> And after three days they came across him in the Temple , seated among the wise men , giving ear to their words and putting questions to them . <EOV> <SOV> And all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him they were surprised , and his mother said to him , Son , why have you done this to us ? see , your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why were you looking for me ? was it not clear to you that my right place was in my Father 's house ? <EOV> <SOV> And his words seemed strange to them . <EOV> <SOV> And he went down with them and came to Nazareth ; and did as he was ordered : and his mother kept all these words in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus was increasing in wisdom and in years , and in grace before God and men . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now in the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being ruler of Judaea , and Herod being king of Galilee , his brother Philip king of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias king of Abilene , <EOV> <SOV> When Annas and Caiaphas were high priests , the word of the Lord came to John , the son of Zacharias , in the waste land . <EOV> <SOV> And he came into all the country round about Jordan , preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed . <EOV> <SOV> As it says in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , The voice of one crying in the waste land , Make ready the way of the Lord , make his roads straight . <EOV> <SOV> Every valley will be lifted up , and all the mountains and hills made low , and the twisted will be made straight , and the rough ways smooth ; <EOV> <SOV> And all flesh will see the salvation of God . <EOV> <SOV> So he said to the people who went out to him for baptism : You offspring of snakes , at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come ? <EOV> <SOV> Make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed ; and do not say to yourselves , We have Abraham for our father : for I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees ; and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> And the people put questions to him , saying , What have we to do ? <EOV> <SOV> And he made answer and said to them , He who has two coats , let him give to him who has not even one ; and he who has food , let him do the same . <EOV> <SOV> Then tax - farmers came to him for baptism and said to him , Master , what have we to do ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount . <EOV> <SOV> And men of the army put questions to him , saying , And what have we to do ? And he said to them , Do no violent acts to any man , and do not take anything without right , and let your payment be enough for you . <EOV> <SOV> And while the people were waiting , and all men were questioning in their hearts about John , if he was the Christ or not , <EOV> <SOV> John made answer , saying to them all , Truly , I give you baptism with water , but one is coming who is greater than I , whose shoes I am not good enough to undo : he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit , and with fire : <EOV> <SOV> In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain ; he will put the good grain in his store , but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out . <EOV> <SOV> And so comforting them with these and other words , he gave the good news to the people ; <EOV> <SOV> But Herod the king , because John had made a protest on account of Herodias , his brother 's wife , and other evil things which Herod had done , <EOV> <SOV> Did this most evil thing of all , and had John shut up in prison . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came about that when all the people had been given baptism , Jesus , having had baptism with them , was in prayer , when , the heaven being open , <EOV> <SOV> The Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove , and a voice came from heaven , saying , You are my dearly loved Son , with whom I am well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus at this time was about thirty years old , being the son ( as it seemed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Matthat , the son of Levi , the son of Melchi , the son of Jannai , the son of Joseph , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Mattathias , the son of Amos , the son of Nahum , the son of Esli , the son of Naggai , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Maath , the son of Mattathias , the son of Semein , the son of Josech , the son of Joda , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Joanan , the son of Rhesa , the son of Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , the son of Neri , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Melchi , the son of Addi , the son of Cosam , the son of Elmadam , the son of Er , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Jesus , the son of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the son of Matthat , the son of Levi , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Symeon , the son of Judas , the son of Joseph , the son of Jonam , the son of Eliakim , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Melea , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Jesse , the son of Obed , the son of Boaz , the son of Salmon , the son of Nahshon , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Amminadab , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Jacob , the son of Isaac , the son of Abraham , the son of Terah , the son of Nahor , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Serug , the son of Reu , the son of Peleg , the son of Eber , the son of Shelah , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Cainan , the son of Arphaxad , the son of Shem , the son of Noah , the son of Lamech , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Methuselah , the son of Enoch , the son of Jared , the son of Mahalaleel , the son of Cainan , <EOV> <SOV> The son of Enos , the son of Seth , the son of Adam , the son of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , came back from the Jordan , and was guided by the Spirit in the waste land <EOV> <SOV> For forty days , being tested by the Evil One . And he had no food in those days ; and when they came to an end , he was in need of food . <EOV> <SOV> And the Evil One said to him , If you are the Son of God , give orders to this stone to become bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus made answer to him , It has been said in the Writings , Bread is not man 's only need . <EOV> <SOV> And he took him up and let him see all the kingdoms of the earth in a minute of time . <EOV> <SOV> And the Evil One said , I will give you authority over all these , and the glory of them , for it has been given to me , and I give it to anyone at my pleasure . <EOV> <SOV> If then you will give worship to me , it will all be yours . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus in answer said to him , It has been said in the Writings , Give worship to the Lord your God , and be his servant only . <EOV> <SOV> And he took him to Jerusalem and put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him , If you are the Son of God , let yourself go down from here ; for it is said in the Writings , <EOV> <SOV> He will give his angels orders to take care of you : <EOV> <SOV> And , In their hands they will keep you up , so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus made answer and said to him , It is said in the Writings , You may not put the Lord your God to the test . <EOV> <SOV> And when all these tests were ended the Evil One went away from him for a time . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus came back to Galilee in the power of the Spirit , and the news of him went through all the country round about . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in their Synagogues and all men gave him praise . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Nazareth , where he had been as a child , and he went , as his way was , into the Synagogue on the Sabbath , and got up to give a reading . <EOV> <SOV> And the book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him and , opening the book , he came on the place where it is said , <EOV> <SOV> The Spirit of the Lord is on me , because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor ; he has sent me to make well those who are broken - hearted ; to say that the prisoners will be let go , and the blind will see , and to make the wounded free from their chains , <EOV> <SOV> To give knowledge that the year of the Lord 's good pleasure is come . <EOV> <SOV> And shutting the book he gave it back to the servant and took his seat : and the eyes of all in the Synagogue were fixed on him . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said to them , Today this word has come true in your hearing . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all giving witness , with wonder , to the words of grace which came from his mouth : and they said , Is not this the son of Joseph ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Without doubt you will say to me , Let the medical man make himself well : the things which to our knowledge were done at Capernaum , do them here in your country . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Truly I say to you , No prophet is honoured in his country . <EOV> <SOV> Truly I say to you , There were a number of widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months and there was no food in the land ; <EOV> <SOV> But Elijah was not sent to one of them , but only to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , to a woman who was a widow . <EOV> <SOV> And there were a number of lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and not one of them was made clean , but only Naaman the Syrian . <EOV> <SOV> And all who were in the Synagogue were very angry when these things were said to them . <EOV> <SOV> And they got up and took him out of the town to the edge of the mountain on which their town was , so that they might send him down to his death . <EOV> <SOV> But he came through them and went on his way . <EOV> <SOV> And he came down to Capernaum , a town of Galilee ; and he was giving them teaching on the Sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And they were surprised at his teaching , for his word was with authority . <EOV> <SOV> And there was a man in the Synagogue who had an unclean spirit ; and he gave a loud cry and said , <EOV> <SOV> Let us be ! what have we to do with you , Jesus of Nazareth ? have you come to put an end to us ? I have knowledge who you are , the Holy One of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Be quiet , and come out of him . And when the evil spirit had put him down on the earth in the middle of them , he came out of him , having done him no damage . <EOV> <SOV> And wonder came on them all and they said to one another , What are these words ? for with authority and power he gives orders to the evil spirits and they come out . <EOV> <SOV> And there was much talk about him in all the places round about . <EOV> <SOV> And he got up and went out of the Synagogue and went into the house of Simon . And Simon 's wife 's mother was very ill with a burning heat ; and in answer to their prayers for her <EOV> <SOV> He went near her , and with a sharp word he gave orders to the disease and it went away from her ; and straight away she got up and took care of their needs . <EOV> <SOV> And at sundown all those who had anyone ill with any sort of disease , took them to him , and he put his hands on every one of them and made them well . <EOV> <SOV> And evil spirits came out of a number of them , crying out and saying , You are the Son of God . But he gave them sharp orders not to say a word , because they had knowledge that he was the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , he came out and went to a waste place ; and great numbers of people came looking for him , and they came to him and would have kept him from going away . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , I have to give the good news of the kingdom of God in other towns , because that is why I was sent . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in the Synagogues of Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now it came about that while the people came pushing to be near him , and to have knowledge of the word of God , he was by a wide stretch of water named Gennesaret ; <EOV> <SOV> And he saw two boats by the edge of the water , but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets . <EOV> <SOV> And he got into one of the boats , the property of Simon , and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land . And being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat . <EOV> <SOV> And when his talk was ended , he said to Simon , Go out into deep water , and let down your nets for fish . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon , answering , said , Master , we were working all night and we took nothing : but at your word I will let down the nets . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had done this , they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken ; <EOV> <SOV> And they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help . And they came , and the two boats were so full that they were going down . <EOV> <SOV> But Simon , when he saw it , went down at the knees of Jesus and said , Go away from me , O Lord , for I am a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him , at the number of fish which they had taken ; <EOV> <SOV> And so were James and John , the sons of Zebedee , who were working with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , Have no fear ; from this time forward you will be a fisher of men . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had got their boats to the land , they gave up everything and went after him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that while he was in one of the towns , there was a leper there : and when he saw Jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him , saying , Lord , if it is your pleasure , you have power to make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And he put out his hand to him and said , It is my pleasure ; be clean . And straight away his disease went from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he gave him orders : Say nothing to any man , but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean , as the law of Moses says , and for a witness to them . <EOV> <SOV> But news of him went out all the more , in every direction , and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases . <EOV> <SOV> But he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that on one of these days he was teaching ; and some Pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there , who had come from every town of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem ; and the power of the Lord was with him , to make those who were ill free from their diseases . <EOV> <SOV> And some men had with them , on a bed , a man who was ill , without power of moving ; and they made attempts to get him in and put him before Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And because of the mass of people , there was no way to get him in ; so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof , on his bed , into the middle in front of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing their faith he said , Man , you have forgiveness for your sins . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and Pharisees were having an argument , saying , Who is this , who has no respect for God ? who is able to give forgiveness for sins , but God only ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , who had knowledge of their thoughts , said to them , Why are you reasoning in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Which is the simpler : to say , You have forgiveness for your sins ; or to say , Get up and go ? <EOV> <SOV> But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins , ( he said to the man who was ill , ) I say to you , Get up , and take up your bed , and go into your house . <EOV> <SOV> And straight away he got up before them , and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to God . <EOV> <SOV> And wonder overcame them all , and they gave glory to God ; and they were full of fear , saying , We have seen strange things today . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he went out , and saw Levi , a tax - farmer , seated at the place where taxes were taken , and said to him , Come after me . <EOV> <SOV> And giving up his business , he got up and went after him . <EOV> <SOV> And Levi made a great feast for him in his house : and a great number of tax - farmers and others were seated at table with them . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples , saying , Why do you take food and drink with tax - farmers and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , answering , said to them , Those who are well have no need of a medical man , but those who are ill . <EOV> <SOV> I have come , not to get the upright , but sinners , so that they may be turned from their sins . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , The disciples of John frequently go without food , and make prayers , and so do the disciples of the Pharisees ; but your disciples take food and drink . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Are you able to make the friends of the newly - married man go without food when he is with them ? <EOV> <SOV> But the days will come when he will be taken away from them , and then they will go without food . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , in a story , No man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat , for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old . <EOV> <SOV> And no man puts new wine into old wine - skins , for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine , and the wine be let out , and the skins come to destruction . <EOV> <SOV> But new wine has to be put into new wine - skins . <EOV> <SOV> And no man , having had old wine , has any desire for new , for he says , The old is better . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now it came about that on the Sabbath he was going through the fields of grain , and his disciples took the heads of the grain for food , crushing them in their hands . <EOV> <SOV> But some of the Pharisees said , Why do you do what it is not right to do on the Sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Have you not seen in the Writings what David did when he was in need of food , he , and those who were with him ; <EOV> <SOV> How he went into the house of God and took for food the holy bread , which only the priests may take , and gave it to those who were with him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about , on another Sabbath , that he went into the Synagogue and was teaching there . And a man was there whose right hand was dead . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and Pharisees were watching him to see if he would make him well on the Sabbath , so that they might be able to say something against him . <EOV> <SOV> But he had knowledge of their thoughts ; and he said to the man whose hand was dead , Get up and come into the middle . And he got up and came forward . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , I put the question to you , Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil ? to give life or to take it away ? <EOV> <SOV> And looking round on all of them , he said to him , Put out your hand . And he did so : and his hand was made well . <EOV> <SOV> But they were full of wrath , and were talking together about what they might do to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about in those days that he went out to the mountain for prayer ; and he was all night in prayer to God . <EOV> <SOV> And the day came and , turning to his disciples , he made a selection from among them of twelve , to whom he gave the name of Apostles ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon , to whom he gave the name of Peter , and Andrew , his brother , and James and John and Philip and Bartholomew <EOV> <SOV> And Matthew and Thomas and James , the son of Alphaeus , and Simon , who was named the Zealot , <EOV> <SOV> And Judas , the son of James , and Judas Iscariot , he who was false to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he came down with them to a level place , and a great band of his disciples , and a very great number of people from all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the parts of Tyre and Sidon by the sea , came to give hearing to him , and to be made well from their diseases ; <EOV> <SOV> And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were made well . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people were desiring to be touched by him , for power came from him and made them all well . <EOV> <SOV> And turning his eyes to his disciples he said , Happy are you who are poor : for the kingdom of God is yours . <EOV> <SOV> Happy are you who are in need of food now : for you will be made full . Happy are you who are weeping now ; for you will be glad . <EOV> <SOV> Happy are you , when men have hate for you , and put you away from among them and say angry words to you , turning away in disgust at your name , because of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Be glad in that day , and be lifted up for joy , for your reward in heaven will be great : for their fathers did these same things to the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But unhappy are you who have wealth : for you have been comforted now . <EOV> <SOV> Unhappy are you who are full of food now : for you will be in need . Unhappy are you who are laughing now : for you will be crying in sorrow . <EOV> <SOV> Unhappy are you when all men give you their approval : for so their fathers did to the false prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you who give ear to me , Have love for those who are against you , do good to those who have hate for you , <EOV> <SOV> Give blessing to those who give you curses , say prayers for those who are cruel to you . <EOV> <SOV> If a man gives you a blow on one side of your face , then let the other side be turned to him ; from him who takes away your coat , do not keep back your robe . <EOV> <SOV> Give to everyone who comes with a request , and if a man takes away your property , make no attempt to get it back again . <EOV> <SOV> Do to others as you would have them do to you . <EOV> <SOV> If you have love for those who have love for you , what credit is it to you ? for even sinners have love for those who have love for them . <EOV> <SOV> And if you do good to those who do good to you , what credit is it to you ? for even sinners do the same . <EOV> <SOV> And if you let those have the use of your money , from whom you are hoping to get it back , what credit is it to you ? even sinners do so to sinners , hoping to get back as much as they gave . <EOV> <SOV> But be loving to those who are against you and do them good , and give them your money , not giving up hope , and your reward will be great and you will be the sons of the Most High : for he is kind to evil men , and to those who have hard hearts . <EOV> <SOV> Be full of pity , even as your Father is full of pity . <EOV> <SOV> Be not judges of others , and you will not be judged : do not give punishment to others , and you will not get punishment yourselves : make others free , and you will be made free : <EOV> <SOV> Give , and it will be given to you ; good measure , crushed down , full and running over , they will give to you . For in the same measure as you give , it will be given to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And he gave them teaching in the form of a story , saying , Is it possible for one blind man to be guide to another ? will they not go falling together into a hole ? <EOV> <SOV> The disciple is not greater than his master , but everyone whose learning is complete will be like his master . <EOV> <SOV> And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother 's eye , but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye ? <EOV> <SOV> How will you say to your brother , Brother , let me take the grain of dust out of your eye , when you yourself do not see the bit of wood in your eye ? O false one ! first take the wood out of your eye and then you will see clearly to take the dust out of your brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> For no good tree gives bad fruit , and no bad tree gives good fruit . <EOV> <SOV> For every tree is judged by its fruit . Men do not get figs from thorns , or grapes from blackberry plants . <EOV> <SOV> The good man , out of the good store of his heart , gives good things ; and the evil man , out of his evil store , gives evil : for out of the full store of the heart come the words of the mouth . <EOV> <SOV> Why do you say to me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? <EOV> <SOV> Everyone who comes to me and gives ear to my words and does them , I will make clear to you what he is like : <EOV> <SOV> He is like a man building a house , who went deep and put the base of it on a rock ; and when the water came up and the river was driving against that house , it was not moved , because the building was good . <EOV> <SOV> But he who gives hearing , without doing , is like a man building a house on the earth without a base for it ; and when the force of the river came against it , straight away it came down ; and the destruction of that house was great . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After he had come to the end of all his words in the hearing of the people , he went into Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him ; this servant was ill and near to death . <EOV> <SOV> And when news of Jesus came to his ears , he sent to him rulers of the Jews , requesting that he would come and make his servant well . <EOV> <SOV> And they , when they came to Jesus , made their request warmly , saying , <EOV> <SOV> It is right for you to do this for him , because he is a friend to our nation , and himself has put up a Synagogue for us . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went with them . And when he was not far from the house , the man sent friends to him , saying , Lord , do not give yourself trouble : for I am not important enough for you to come into my house : <EOV> <SOV> And I had the feeling that I was not even good enough to come to you : but say the word only , and my servant will be well . <EOV> <SOV> For I , myself , am a man under authority , having men under me ; and I say to this one , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my servant , Do this , and he does it . <EOV> <SOV> And when these things were said to Jesus , he was surprised , and , turning to the mass of people coming after him , said , I have not seen such great faith , no , not in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about , after a little time , that he went to a town named Nain ; and his disciples went with him , and a great number of people . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he came near the door of the town , a dead man was being taken out , the only son of his mother , who was a widow : and a great number of people from the town were with her . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Lord saw her , he had pity on her and said to her , Be not sad . <EOV> <SOV> And he came near , and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was : and those who were moving it came to a stop . And he said , Young man , I say to you , Get up . <EOV> <SOV> And the dead man got up , and words came from his lips . And he gave him to his mother . <EOV> <SOV> And fear came on all , and they gave praise to God , saying , A great prophet is among us : and , God has given thought to his people . <EOV> <SOV> And this story about him went through all Judaea and the places round about . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John gave him an account of all these things . <EOV> <SOV> Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord , saying , Are you he who is to come , or are we waiting for another ? <EOV> <SOV> And when the men came to him they said , John the Baptist has sent us to you , saying , Are you he who is to come , or are we waiting for another ? <EOV> <SOV> At that time , he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains , and from evil spirits ; and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes . <EOV> <SOV> And answering them he said , Go back and give news to John of what you have seen , and the things which have come to your ears ; the blind now see , those who had no power in their legs are walking , lepers are made clean , those who had no hearing now have their ears open , dead men come to life again , and the poor have the good news given to them . <EOV> <SOV> And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me . <EOV> <SOV> And when the men who were sent by John had gone away , he said to the people , about John , What did you go out into the waste land to see ? a tall stem moving in the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what did you go out to see ? a man in soft clothing ? See now , those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings ' houses . <EOV> <SOV> But what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> This is he of whom it has been said , See , I send my servant before your face , who will make ready your way before you . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , Among all the sons of women , not one is greater than John : but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> ( And all the people , and the tax - farmers , to whom John had given baptism , when they had knowledge of these things , gave glory to God . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of God for themselves , not having had his baptism . ) <EOV> <SOV> What comparison am I to make of the men of this generation ? what are they like ? <EOV> <SOV> They are like children who are seated in the market - place , crying out to one another , and saying , We made music for you , but you did not take part in the dance ; we gave cries of sorrow , but you were not sad . <EOV> <SOV> For John the Baptist came , taking no food or drink , and you say , He has an evil spirit . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man came feasting , and you say , Here is a lover of food and wine , a friend of tax - farmers and sinners . <EOV> <SOV> But wisdom is judged to be right by all her children . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the Pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him . And he went into the Pharisee 's house and took his seat at the table . <EOV> <SOV> And there was a woman in the town who was a sinner ; and when she had news that he was a guest in the Pharisee 's house , she took a bottle of perfume , <EOV> <SOV> And went in and took her place at the back of him , near his feet , weeping , so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes , and with her hair she made them dry , and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the Pharisee in whose house he was saw it , he said to himself , This man , if he was a prophet , would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him , that she is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , answering , said , Simon , I have something to say to you . And he said , Master , say on . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Two men were in debt to a certain man of business : one had a debt of five hundred pence , and the other of fifty . <EOV> <SOV> When they were unable to make payment , he made the two of them free of their debts . Which of them , now , will have the greater love for him ? <EOV> <SOV> Simon , in answer , said , It seems he whose debt was greater . And he said , Your decision is right . <EOV> <SOV> And turning to the woman he said to Simon , You see this woman ? I came into your house ; you did not give me water for my feet : but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes , and drying them with her hair . <EOV> <SOV> You did not give me a kiss : but she , from the time when I came in , has gone on kissing my feet . <EOV> <SOV> You put no oil on my head : but she has put perfume on my feet . <EOV> <SOV> And so I say to you , She will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number , because of her great love : but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , You have forgiveness for your sins . <EOV> <SOV> And those who were seated at table with him said to themselves , Who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the woman , By your faith you have salvation ; go in peace . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came about , after a short time , that he went through town and country giving the good news of the kingdom of God , and with him were the twelve , <EOV> <SOV> And certain women who had been made free from evil spirits and diseases , Mary named Magdalene , from whom seven evil spirits had gone out , <EOV> <SOV> And Joanna , the wife of Chuza , Herod 's chief house - servant , and Susanna and a number of others , who gave him of their wealth for his needs . <EOV> <SOV> And when a great number of people came together , and men from every town went out to him , he gave them teaching in the form of a story : <EOV> <SOV> A man went out to put in seed , and while he was doing it , some was dropped by the wayside and it was crushed under foot , and was taken by the birds of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And some went on the rock , and when it came up it became dry and dead because it had no water . <EOV> <SOV> And some went among thorns , and the thorns came up with it and it had no room for growth . <EOV> <SOV> And some falling on good earth , came up and gave fruit a hundred times as much . And with these words he said in a loud voice , He who has ears , let him give ear . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples put questions to him about the point of the story . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , To you is given knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God ; but to the others , they are given in stories , so that seeing , they may not see , and though they give hearing , the sense will not be clear to them . <EOV> <SOV> Now this is the point of the story : The seed is the word of God . <EOV> <SOV> Those by the side of the road are those who have given hearing ; then the Evil One comes and takes away the word from their hearts , so that they may not have faith and get salvation . <EOV> <SOV> And those on the rock are those who with joy give hearing to the word ; but having no root , they have faith for a time , and when the test comes they give up . <EOV> <SOV> And those which went among thorns are those who have given hearing , and go on their way , but they are overcome by cares and wealth and the pleasures of life , and they give no fruit . <EOV> <SOV> And those in the good earth are those who , having given ear to the word , keep it with a good and true heart , and in quiet strength give fruit . <EOV> <SOV> No man , when the light is lighted , puts a cover over it , or puts it under a bed , but he puts it on its table , so that those who come in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> For nothing is put out of view which will not be made clear , and nothing is secret of which the knowledge will not come to light . <EOV> <SOV> So take care how you give hearing , for to him who has will be given , and from him who has not will be taken even what he seems to have . <EOV> <SOV> And his mother and his brothers came to him , and they were not able to get near him because of the great number of people . <EOV> <SOV> And someone said to him , Your mother and your brothers are outside desiring to see you . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them in answer , My mother and my brothers are those who have knowledge of the word of God and do it . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came about on one of those days that he got into a boat with his disciples ; and he said to them , Let us go over to the other side of the water : and they put out the boat . <EOV> <SOV> But while they were sailing he went to sleep : and a storm of wind came down on the sea , and the boat became full of water and they were in danger . <EOV> <SOV> Then they came to him and , awaking him out of his sleep , said , Master , Master , destruction is near . And he , when he was awake , gave orders to the wind and the rolling waves , and the storm came to an end , and all was calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Where is your faith ? And fear and wonder overcame them , and they said to one another , Who then is this , who gives orders even to the winds and the water and they do what he says ? <EOV> <SOV> And they came to the country of the Gerasenes , which is opposite Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come to the land , there came to him a certain man from the town who had evil spirits ; and for a long time he had had no clothing on , and was not living in a house but in the place of the dead . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw Jesus , he gave a loud cry and went down on the earth before him and in a loud voice said , What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? Do not be cruel to me . <EOV> <SOV> For he gave an order to the evil spirit to come out of the man . For frequently it would take a grip of him : and he was kept under control , and prisoned with chains ; but parting the chains in two , he would be sent by the driving of the evil spirit into waste places . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , What is your name ? And he said , Legion ; for a number of spirits had gone into him . <EOV> <SOV> And they made a request to him that he would not give them an order to go away into the deep . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was a great herd of pigs in that place , getting food on the mountain : and the evil spirits made a request to him that he would let them go into the pigs , and he let them . <EOV> <SOV> And the evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs : and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the water and came to destruction . <EOV> <SOV> And when the men who took care of them saw what had come about , they went quickly and gave news of it in the town and the country . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out to see what had taken place , and they came to Jesus and saw the man out of whom the evil spirits had gone , seated , clothed and with full use of his senses , at the feet of Jesus ; and fear came on them . <EOV> <SOV> And those who had seen it gave them an account of how the man who had the evil spirits was made well . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes made a request to him to go away from them ; for they were in great fear : and he got into a boat and went back . <EOV> <SOV> But the man from whom the evil spirits had gone out had a great desire to be with him , but he sent him away , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Go back to your house and let them have news of all the great things which God has done for you . And he went away , giving word through all the town of the great things which Jesus had done for him . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus went back , the people were glad to see him , for they were all waiting for him . <EOV> <SOV> Then there came a man named Jairus , who was a ruler in the Synagogue : and he went down at the feet of Jesus , desiring him to come to his house ; <EOV> <SOV> For he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was near to death . But while he was on his way , the people were pushing to be near him . <EOV> <SOV> And a woman , who had had a flow of blood for twelve years , and had given all her money to medical men , and not one of them was able to make her well , <EOV> <SOV> Came after him and put her hand on the edge of his robe , and straight away the flowing of her blood was stopped . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Who was touching me ? And when they all said , It is not I , Peter and those who were with him said , Master , the people are pushing round you on every side . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Someone was touching me , for I had the feeling that power had gone out from me . <EOV> <SOV> And when the woman saw that she was not able to keep it secret , she came , shaking with fear , and falling down before him she made clear before all the people the reason for her touching him , and how she was made well straight away . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , Daughter , your faith has made you well ; go in peace . <EOV> <SOV> While he was still talking , someone came from the house of the ruler of the Synagogue , saying , Your daughter is dead ; do not go on troubling the Master . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus at these words said to him , Have no fear , only have faith , and she will be made well . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to the house he did not let any man go in with him , but only Peter and John and James , and the father of the girl and her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people were weeping and crying for her ; but he said , Do not be sad , for she is not dead , but sleeping . <EOV> <SOV> And they were laughing at him , being certain that she was dead . <EOV> <SOV> But he , taking her hand , said to her , My child , get up . <EOV> <SOV> And her spirit came back to her and she got up straight away : and he gave orders that food was to be given to her . <EOV> <SOV> And her father and mother were full of wonder , but he gave orders to them to say nothing about it to anyone . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And getting the twelve together , he gave them power and authority over all evil spirits and over diseases , to make them well . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent them out to be preachers of the kingdom of God , and to make well those who were ill . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take nothing for your journey , no stick or bag or bread or money , and do not take two coats . <EOV> <SOV> And if you go into a house , let that house be your resting - place till you go away . <EOV> <SOV> And if any people will not take you in , when you go away from that town , put off its dust from your feet for a witness against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they went away , journeying through all the towns , preaching the good news and making people free from diseases in all places . <EOV> <SOV> Now Herod the king had news of all these things : and he was in doubt , because it was said by some people that John had come back from the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> And by some , that Elijah had come ; and by others , that one of the old prophets had come back to life . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod said , I put John to death : but who is this , of whom such stories are given to me ? And he had a desire to see him . <EOV> <SOV> And the twelve , when they came back , gave him an account of what they had done . And he took them with him and went away from the people to a town named Beth - saida . <EOV> <SOV> But the people , getting news of it , went after him : and he was pleased to see them , and gave them teaching about the kingdom of God , and made those well who were in need of it . <EOV> <SOV> And the day went on ; and the twelve came to him and said , Send these people away so that they may go into the towns and the country round about and get resting - places and food for themselves , for we are in a waste place . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Give them food yourselves . And they said , We have only five cakes of bread and two fishes , if we do not go and get food for all these people . <EOV> <SOV> For there were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them be seated in groups , about fifty to a group . <EOV> <SOV> And they did so , and made them all be seated . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the five cakes of bread and the two fishes and , looking up to heaven , he said words of blessing over them , and when they had been broken , he gave them to the disciples to give to the people . <EOV> <SOV> And they all took the food and had enough ; and they took up of the broken bits which were over , twelve baskets full . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that when he was in prayer , by himself , and the disciples were with him , he put a question to them , saying , Who do the people say I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And they , answering , said , John the Baptist ; but others say Elijah ; and others , that one of the old prophets has come back . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , But who do you say that I am ? And Peter , answering , said , The Christ of God . <EOV> <SOV> But he gave them special orders , not to say this to any man ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The Son of man will undergo much and be put on one side by the rulers and the chief priests and the teachers of the law , and be put to death , and on the third day he will come back to life . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them all , If any man has a desire to come after me , let him give up all , and take up his cross every day , and come after me . <EOV> <SOV> For whoever has a desire to keep his life will have it taken from him , but whoever gives up his life because of me , will keep it . <EOV> <SOV> For what profit will a man have if he gets all the world , but undergoes loss or destruction himself ? <EOV> <SOV> For if any man has a feeling of shame because of me or of my words , the Son of man will have shame because of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels . <EOV> <SOV> But truly I say to you , Some of those who are here now will have no taste of death till they see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And about eight days after he had said these things , he took Peter and John and James with him and went up into the mountain for prayer . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was in prayer , his face was changed and his clothing became white and shining . <EOV> <SOV> And two men , Moses and Elijah , were talking with him ; <EOV> <SOV> Who were seen in glory and were talking of his death which was about to take place in Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Now Peter and those who were with him were overcome with sleep : but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory and the two men who were with him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were about to go away from him , Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here ; let us make three tents , one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah : having no knowledge of what he was saying . <EOV> <SOV> And while he said these things , the shade of a cloud came over them , and they were full of fear when they went into the cloud . <EOV> <SOV> And there was a voice from the cloud saying , This is my Son , the man of my selection ; give ear to him . <EOV> <SOV> And after the voice was gone they saw that Jesus was by himself . And they kept quiet , and said nothing at that time to anyone of the things which they had seen . <EOV> <SOV> And on the day after , when they came down from the mountain , a great band of people came to him . <EOV> <SOV> And a man from among them , crying out , said , Master , I make a request to you , give a thought to my son , for he is my only child : <EOV> <SOV> And see , a spirit takes him , and suddenly he gives a cry , twisted in pain and streaming at the lips , and when it goes away from him at last , he is marked as from blows . <EOV> <SOV> And I made a request to your disciples to send it out of him , but they were not able to do it . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , O generation without faith and false in heart , how long will I have to be with you and put up with you ? let your son come here . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was coming , he was pushed violently down and twisted by the evil spirit . But Jesus gave sharp orders to the unclean spirit , and made the boy well , and gave him back to his father . <EOV> <SOV> And they were full of wonder at the great power of God . But while they were all wondering at all the things which he did , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Let these words go deep into your ears , for the Son of man will be given up into the hands of men . <EOV> <SOV> But this saying was not clear to them and its sense was kept secret from them so that they were not able to see it : and they had fear of questioning him about it . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was a discussion among them about which of them would be the greatest . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their hearts , he took a small child and put him by his side , <EOV> <SOV> And said to them , Whoever gives honour to this child in my name , gives honour to me : and whoever gives honour to me , gives honour to him who sent me : for whoever is least among you all , that man is great . <EOV> <SOV> And John , answering , said , Master , we saw a man driving out evil spirits in your name , and we did not let him do it , because he was not one of us . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Let him do it , for he who is not against you is for you . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that when the days were near for him to be taken up , his face was turned to go to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> And he sent men before : and they came to a small town of Samaria to make ready for him . <EOV> <SOV> But they would not have him there , because he was clearly going to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , Lord , may we send fire from heaven and put an end to them ? <EOV> <SOV> But turning round he said sharp words to them . <EOV> <SOV> And they went to another small town . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were on the way , a certain man said to him , I will come after you wherever you go . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have resting - places , but the Son of man has nowhere to put his head . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to another , Come after me . But he said , Lord , let me first go and give the last honours to my father . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to him , Let the dead take care of their dead ; it is for you to go and give news of the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And another man said , I will come with you , Lord , but first let me say a last good - day to those who are at my house . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , No man , having put his hand to the plough and looking back , is good enough for the kingdom of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now after these things , the Lord made selection of seventy others and sent them before him , two together , into every town and place where he himself was about to come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , There is much grain ready to be cut , but not enough workers : so make prayer to the Lord of the grain - fields that he will send workers to get in the grain . <EOV> <SOV> Go on your way : see , I send you out like lambs among wolves . <EOV> <SOV> Take no bag for money or for food , and no shoes ; say no word to any man on the way . <EOV> <SOV> And whenever you go into a house , first say , Peace be to this house . <EOV> <SOV> And if a son of peace is there , your peace will be with him : but if not , it will come back to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And keep in that same house , taking what food and drink they give you : for the worker has a right to his reward . Do not go from house to house . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatever town you go , if they take you in , take whatever food is given to you : <EOV> <SOV> And make well those in it who are ill and say to them , The kingdom of God is near to you . <EOV> <SOV> But if you go into a town where they will not have you , go out into the streets of it and say , <EOV> <SOV> Even the dust of your town , which is on our feet , we put off as a witness against you ; but be certain of this , that the kingdom of God is near . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , It will be better in that day for Sodom than for that town . <EOV> <SOV> A curse is on you , Chorazin ! A curse is on you , Beth - saida ! For if such works of power had been done in Tyre and Sidon as have been done in you , they would have been turned from their sins , in days gone by , seated in the dust . <EOV> <SOV> But it will be better for Tyre and Sidon , in the day of judging , than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And you , Capernaum , were you not lifted up to heaven ? you will go down to hell . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever gives ear to you , gives ear to me ; and whoever is against you , is against me ; and whoever is against me , is against him who sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the seventy came back with joy , saying , Lord , even the evil spirits are under our power in your name . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I was watching for Satan , falling from heaven like a star . <EOV> <SOV> See , I have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts , and over all the strength of him who is against you : and nothing will do you damage . <EOV> <SOV> Do not be glad , however , because you have power over spirits , but because your names are recorded in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> In that same hour he was full of joy in the Holy Spirit and said , I give praise to you , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning , and have made them clear to little children : for so , O Father , it was pleasing in your eyes . <EOV> <SOV> All things have been given to me by my Father : and no one has knowledge of the Son , but only the Father : and of the Father , but only the Son , and he to whom the Son will make it clear . <EOV> <SOV> And , turning to the disciples , he said privately , Happy are the eyes which see the things you see : <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see , and have not seen them , and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears , and they had it not . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test , saying , Master , what have I to do so that I may have eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , What does the law say , in your reading of it ? <EOV> <SOV> And he , answering , said , Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind ; and for your neighbour as for yourself . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , You have given the right answer : do this and you will have life . <EOV> <SOV> But he , desiring to put himself in the right , said to Jesus , And who is my neighbour ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , answering him , said , A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and he got into the hands of thieves , who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows , and when they went away , he was half dead . <EOV> <SOV> And by chance a certain priest was going down that way : and when he saw him , he went by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And in the same way , a Levite , when he came to the place and saw him , went by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain man of Samaria , journeying that way , came where he was , and when he saw him , he was moved with pity for him , <EOV> <SOV> And came to him and put clean linen round his wounds , with oil and wine ; and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him . <EOV> <SOV> And the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said , Take care of him ; and if this money is not enough , when I come again I will give you whatever more is needed . <EOV> <SOV> Which of these three men , in your opinion , was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , The one who had mercy on him . And Jesus said , Go and do the same . <EOV> <SOV> Now , while they were on their way , he came to a certain town ; and a woman named Martha took him into her house . <EOV> <SOV> And she had a sister , by name Mary , who took her seat at the Lord 's feet and gave attention to his words . <EOV> <SOV> But Martha had her hands full of the work of the house , and she came to him and said , Lord , is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work ? Say to her that she is to give me some help . <EOV> <SOV> But the Lord , answering , said to her , Martha , Martha , you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things : <EOV> <SOV> Little is needed , or even one thing only : for Mary has taken that good part , which will not be taken away from her . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came about that he was in prayer in a certain place , and when he came to an end , one of his disciples said to him , Lord , will you give us teaching about prayer , as John did to his disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , When you say your prayers , say , Father , may your name be kept holy and your kingdom come . <EOV> <SOV> Give us every day bread for our needs . <EOV> <SOV> May we have forgiveness for our sins , as we make free all those who are in debt to us . And let us not be put to the test . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Which of you , having a friend , would go to him in the middle of the night and say to him , Friend , let me have three cakes of bread ; <EOV> <SOV> Because a friend of mine has come to me on a journey , and I have nothing to put before him ; <EOV> <SOV> And he , from inside the house , would say in answer , Do not be a trouble to me ; the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; it is not possible for me to get up and give to you ? <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , Though he will not get up and give to him , because he is his friend , still , if he keeps on making his request , he will get up and give him as much as he has need of . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , Make requests , and they will be answered ; what you are searching for , you will get ; when you give the sign , the door will be open to you . <EOV> <SOV> For to everyone who makes a request , it will be given ; and he who is searching will get his desire ; and to him who gives the sign , the door will be open . <EOV> <SOV> And which of you , being a father , will give a stone to his son , who makes request for bread ? or for a fish , will give him a snake ? <EOV> <SOV> Or for an egg , will give him a scorpion ? <EOV> <SOV> If , then , you who are evil are able to give good things to your children , how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who make request to him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he was sending an evil spirit out of a man who was without the power of talking . And it came about that when the spirit had gone the man had the power of talking ; and the people were full of wonder . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them said , He sends out evil spirits by Beelzebul , the ruler of evil spirits . <EOV> <SOV> And others , testing him , were looking for a sign from heaven from him . <EOV> <SOV> But he , having knowledge of their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom in which there is division is made waste ; and a house in which there is division comes to destruction . <EOV> <SOV> If , then , Satan is at war with himself , how will he keep his kingdom ? because you say that I send evil spirits out of men by the help of Beelzebul . <EOV> <SOV> And if I , by Beelzebul , send out evil spirits , by whose help do your sons send them out ? so let them be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if I , by the finger of God , send out evil spirits , then the kingdom of God has overtaken you . <EOV> <SOV> When the strong man armed keeps watch over his house , then his goods are safe : <EOV> <SOV> But when one who is stronger makes an attack on him and overcomes him , he takes away his instruments of war , in which he had put his faith , and makes division of his goods . <EOV> <SOV> He who is not with me is against me , and he who will not give me help in getting people together is driving them away . <EOV> <SOV> The unclean spirit , when he has gone out of a man , goes through dry places , looking for rest ; and when he does not get it , he says , I will go back to my house from which I came . <EOV> <SOV> And when he comes , he sees that it has been made fair and clean . <EOV> <SOV> Then he goes and gets seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they go in , and take their places there : and the last condition of that man is worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that when he said these things , a certain woman among the people said in a loud voice , Happy is the body which gave you birth , and the breasts from which you took milk . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , More happy are they who give hearing to the word of God and keep it . <EOV> <SOV> And when a great number of people came together to him , he said , This generation is an evil generation : it is looking for a sign and no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jonah . <EOV> <SOV> For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so will the Son of man be to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> The queen of the South will come up on the day of judging and give her decision against the men of this generation : for she came from the ends of the earth to give ear to the wisdom of Solomon ; and now something greater than Solomon is here . <EOV> <SOV> The men of Nineveh will come up in the day of judging and give their decision against this generation : for they were turned away from their sins at the preaching of Jonah ; but now something greater than Jonah is here . <EOV> <SOV> No man , when the light has been lighted , puts it in a secret place , or under a vessel , but on its table , so that those who come in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> The light of the body is the eye : when your eye is true , all your body is full of light ; but when it is evil , your body is dark . <EOV> <SOV> So take care that the light which is in you is not dark . <EOV> <SOV> If , then , all your body is light , with no part of it dark , it will be completely full of light , as when a flame with its bright shining gives you light . <EOV> <SOV> Now , while he was talking , a Pharisee made a request that he would come to a meal with him ; and he went in and took his seat at the meal . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Pharisee saw it , he was surprised because he came to the meal without first washing himself . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said to him , You Pharisees make the outside of the cup and the plate clean ; but inside you are thieves and full of evil . <EOV> <SOV> O you foolish ones ! did not he who made the outside in the same way make the inside ? <EOV> <SOV> But if you give to the poor such things as you are able , then all things are clean to you . <EOV> <SOV> But a curse is on you , Pharisees ! for you make men give a tenth of every sort of plant , and give no thought to right and the love of God ; but it is right for you to do these things , and not let the others be undone . <EOV> <SOV> A curse is on you , Pharisees ! for your desires are for the most important seats in the Synagogues and for words of respect said to you in the market - place . <EOV> <SOV> A curse is on you ! for you are like the resting - places of dead men , which are not seen , and men go walking over them without knowledge of it . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the teachers of the law , answering , said to him , Master , in saying this , you give a bad name to us as to them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A curse is on you , teachers of the law ! for while other men are crushed under the weight of the rules you make for them , you yourselves do not put so much as one finger to them . <EOV> <SOV> A curse is on you ! for you make resting - places for the bodies of the prophets , but your fathers put them to death . <EOV> <SOV> So you are witnesses and give approval to the work of your fathers ; for they put them to death and you make their last resting - places . <EOV> <SOV> For this reason the wisdom of God has said , I will send them prophets and teachers , and to some of them they will give death and cruel pains ; <EOV> <SOV> So that punishment may come on this generation for the blood of all the prophets which was given from the earliest days ; <EOV> <SOV> From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah , who was put to death between the altar and the Temple . Yes , I say to you , It will come on this generation . <EOV> <SOV> A curse is on you , teachers of the law ! for you have taken away the key of knowledge : you did not go in yourselves , and you got in the way of those who were going in . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come out of that place , the scribes and the Pharisees came round him angrily , questioning him about more things ; <EOV> <SOV> And watching him , for a chance to get something from his words which might be used against him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that time , when thousands of the people had come together , in such numbers that they were crushing one another , he said first to his disciples , Have nothing to do with the leaven of the Pharisees , which is deceit . <EOV> <SOV> But nothing is covered up , which will not come to light , or secret , which will not be made clear . <EOV> <SOV> So , whatever you have said in the dark , will come to men 's hearing in the light , and what you have said secretly inside the house , will be made public from the house - tops . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , my friends , Have no fear of those who may put the body to death , and are able to do no more than that . <EOV> <SOV> But I will make clear to you of whom you are to be in fear : of him who after death has power to send you to hell ; yes , truly I say , Have fear of him . <EOV> <SOV> Are not five sparrows given in exchange for two farthings ? and God has every one of them in mind . <EOV> <SOV> But even the hairs of your head are numbered . Have no fear : you are of more value than a flock of sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you that to everyone who gives witness to me before men , the Son of man will give witness before the angels of God . <EOV> <SOV> But if anyone says before men that he has no knowledge of me , I will say that I have no knowledge of him before the angels of God . <EOV> <SOV> And if anyone says a word against the Son of man , he will have forgiveness : but for him who says evil words against the Holy Spirit , there will be no forgiveness . <EOV> <SOV> And when they take you before the Synagogues and the authorities and the rulers , take no thought about what answers you will give , or what you will say : <EOV> <SOV> For the Holy Spirit will make clear to you in that very hour what to say . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the people said to him , Master , give an order to my brother to make division of the heritage with me . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Man , who made me a judge or a maker of decisions for you ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take care to keep yourselves free from the desire for property ; for a man 's life is not made up of the number of things which he has . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , in a story , The land of a certain man of great wealth was very fertile : <EOV> <SOV> And he said to himself , What is to be done ? for I have no place in which to put all my fruit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , This I will do : I will take down my store - houses and make greater ones , and there I will put all my grain and my goods . <EOV> <SOV> And I will say to my soul , Soul , you have a great amount of goods in store , enough for a number of years ; be at rest , take food and wine and be happy . <EOV> <SOV> But God said to him , You foolish one , tonight I will take your soul from you , and who then will be the owner of all the things which you have got together ? <EOV> <SOV> So that is what comes to the man who gets wealth for himself , and has not wealth in the eyes of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to his disciples , For this reason I say to you , Take no thought for your life , about what food you will take , or for your body , how it may be clothed . <EOV> <SOV> Is not life more than food , and the body than its clothing ? <EOV> <SOV> Give thought to the ravens ; they do not put seeds into the earth , or get together grain ; they have no store - houses or buildings ; and God gives them their food : of how much greater value are you than the birds ! <EOV> <SOV> And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself any taller ? <EOV> <SOV> If , then , you are not able to do even that which is least , why are you troubled about the rest ? <EOV> <SOV> Give thought to the flowers : they do no work , they make no thread ; and still I say to you , Even Solomon , in all his glory , was not clothed like one of these . <EOV> <SOV> But if God gives such clothing to the grass in the field , which today is living , and tomorrow will be burned in the oven , how much more will he give clothing to you , O men of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And do not give overmuch thought to your food and drink , and let not your mind be full of doubts . <EOV> <SOV> For the nations of the world go in search of all these things : but your Father has knowledge that you have need of them . <EOV> <SOV> But let your chief care be for his kingdom , and these other things will be given to you in addition . <EOV> <SOV> Have no fear , little flock , for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> Give what property you have in exchange for money , and give the money to the poor ; make for yourselves money - bags which will not get old , wealth stored up in heaven which will be yours for ever , where thieves will not come nor worms put it to destruction . <EOV> <SOV> For where your wealth is , there will your heart be . <EOV> <SOV> Be ready , dressed as for a journey , with your lights burning . <EOV> <SOV> And be like men who are looking for their lord , when he comes back from the bride - feast ; so that when he comes to the door , it will be open to him quickly . <EOV> <SOV> Happy are those servants who are watching when the lord comes ; truly I say to you , he will make himself their servant and , placing them at the table , he will come out and give them food . <EOV> <SOV> And if he comes in the second division of the night or in the third , and they are watching for him , happy are those servants . <EOV> <SOV> But be certain of this , that if the master of the house had had knowledge of the time when the thief was coming , he would have been watching , and would not have let his house be broken into . <EOV> <SOV> So be ready : for the Son of man is coming at a time when you are not looking for him . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said to him , Lord , are these words said to us only , or to all men ? <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Who then is the wise and responsible servant whom his lord will put in control of his family , to give them their food at the right time ? <EOV> <SOV> Happy is that servant who , when his lord comes , is doing so . <EOV> <SOV> Truly I say to you , he will put him in control of all his goods . <EOV> <SOV> But if that servant says to himself , My lord is a long time coming ; and goes about giving blows to the men - servants and the women - servants , feasting and taking overmuch wine ; <EOV> <SOV> The lord of that servant will come at a time when he is not looking for him , and at an hour when he is not ready for him , and he will have him cut in two and will give him his part in the fate of those who have no faith ; <EOV> <SOV> And the servant who had knowledge of his lord 's desires and was not ready for him and did not do as he was ordered , will be given a great number of blows ; <EOV> <SOV> But he who , without knowledge , did things for which punishment is given , will get only a small number of blows . The man to whom much is given , will have to give much ; if much is given into his care , of him more will be requested . <EOV> <SOV> I came to send a fire on the earth , and it may even now have been lighted . <EOV> <SOV> But there is a baptism which I have to undergo ; and how am I kept back till it is complete ! <EOV> <SOV> Is it your opinion that I have come to give peace on earth ? I say to you , No , but division : <EOV> <SOV> For from this time , a family of five in one house will be on opposite sides , three against two and two against three . <EOV> <SOV> They will be at war , the father against his son , and the son against his father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against mother ; mother - in - law against daughter - in - law , and daughter - in - law against mother - in - law . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said to the people , When you see a cloud coming up in the west , straight away you say , There will be rain ; and so it is . <EOV> <SOV> And when you see a south wind blowing , you say , There will be heat ; and so it is . <EOV> <SOV> O false ones ! the face of the earth and the heaven is clear to you ; how is it that the signs of these times are not as clear to you ? <EOV> <SOV> And why are you , in your hearts , unable to be judges of what is right ? <EOV> <SOV> For if anyone has a cause at law against you , and you are going with him before the ruler , make an attempt , on the way , to come to an agreement with him , for if you do not , he may take you before the judge and the judge will give you up to the police , and they will put you in prison . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , You will not come out of it till you have made payment to the very last farthing . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now some people who were there at that time , gave him an account of how the blood of some Galilaeans had been mixed by Pilate with their offerings . <EOV> <SOV> And he , in answer , said to them , Are you of the opinion that these Galilaeans were worse than all other Galilaeans , because these things were done to them ? <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , It is not so : but if your hearts are not changed , you will all come to the same end . <EOV> <SOV> Or those eighteen men who were crushed by the fall of the tower of Siloam , were they worse than all the other men living in Jerusalem ? <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , It is not so : but if your hearts are not changed , you will all come to an end in the same way . <EOV> <SOV> And he made up this story for them : A certain man had a fig - tree in his garden , and he came to get fruit from it , and there was no fruit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the gardener , See , for three years I have been looking for fruit from this tree , and I have not had any : let it be cut down ; why is it taking up space ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Lord , let it be for this year , and I will have the earth turned up round it , and put animal waste on it , to make it fertile : <EOV> <SOV> And if , after that , it has fruit , it is well ; if not , let it be cut down . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And there was a woman who had had a disease for eighteen years ; she was bent , and was not able to make herself straight . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw her , he said to her , Woman , you are made free from your disease . <EOV> <SOV> And he put his hands on her , and she was made straight , and gave praise to God . <EOV> <SOV> And the ruler of the Synagogue was angry because Jesus had made her well on the Sabbath , and he said to the people , There are six days in which men may do work : so come on those days to be made well , and not on the Sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But the Lord gave him an answer and said , O you false men ! do you not , every one of you , on the Sabbath , let loose his ox and his ass and take it to the water ? <EOV> <SOV> And is it not right for this daughter of Abraham , who has been in the power of Satan for eighteen years , to be made free on the Sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he said these things , those who were against him were shamed , and all the people were full of joy because of the great things which were done by him . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said , What is the kingdom of God like ? what comparison may I make of it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden , and it became a tree , and the birds of heaven made their resting - places in its branches . <EOV> <SOV> And again he said , What is the kingdom of God like ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like leaven , which a woman put into three measures of meal , and it was all leavened . <EOV> <SOV> And he went on his way , through towns and country places , teaching and journeying to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And someone said to him , Lord , will only a small number have salvation ? And he said to them , <EOV> <SOV> Do your best to go in by the narrow door , for I say to you , A number will make the attempt to go in , but will not be able to do so . <EOV> <SOV> When the master of the house has got up , and the door has been shut , and you , still outside , give blows on the door , saying , Lord , let us in ; he will make answer and say , I have no knowledge of where you come from . <EOV> <SOV> Then you will say , We have taken food and drink with you , and you were teaching in our streets . <EOV> <SOV> But he will say , Truly , I have no knowledge of you or where you come from ; go away from me , you workers of evil . <EOV> <SOV> There will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , but you yourselves are shut outside . <EOV> <SOV> And they will come from the east and from the west , from the north and from the south , and take their places in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the last will be first , and the first will be last . <EOV> <SOV> At that time , certain Pharisees came to him and said , Go away from this place , because Herod 's purpose is to put you to death . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Go and say to that fox , I send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow , and on the third day my work will be complete . <EOV> <SOV> But I have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day , for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , putting to death the prophets , and stoning those who were sent to her ! again and again would I have taken your children to myself , as a bird takes her young ones under her wings , but you would not ! <EOV> <SOV> Now see , your house is waste , and I say to you , You will not see me again till you say , A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came about that when he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the Sabbath , to have a meal , they were watching him . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain man was there who had a disease . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , answering , said to the scribes and Pharisees , Is it right to make people well on the Sabbath or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But they said nothing . And he made him well and sent him away . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Which of you , whose ox or ass has got into a water - hole , will not straight away get him out on the Sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And they had no answer to that question . <EOV> <SOV> And he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast , when he saw how they took the best seats ; saying to them , <EOV> <SOV> When you get a request to come to a feast , do not take the best seat , for a more important man than you may be coming , <EOV> <SOV> And then the giver of the feast will come to you and say , Give your place to this man ; and you , with shame , will have to take the lowest seat . <EOV> <SOV> But when you come , go and take the lowest seat , so that when the giver of the feast comes , he may say to you , Friend , come up higher ; and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there . <EOV> <SOV> For every man who gives himself a high place will be put down , but he who takes a low place will be lifted up . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the master of the house , When you give a feast , do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth , for they may give a feast for you , and so you will get a reward . <EOV> <SOV> But when you give a feast , send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body : <EOV> <SOV> And you will have a blessing , because they will not be able to give you any payment , and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> And , hearing these words , one of those who were at table with him said to him , Happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , A certain man gave a great feast , and sent word of it to a number of people . <EOV> <SOV> And when the time had come , he sent his servants to say to them , Come , for all things are now ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they all gave reasons why they were not able to come . The first said to him , I have got a new field , and it is necessary for me to go and see it : I am full of regret that I am unable to come . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have got some cattle , and I am going to make a test of them : I am full of regret that I am unable to come . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have been married , and so I am not able to come . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things . Then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant , Go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor , the blind , and those who are broken in body . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant said , Lord , your orders have been done , and still there is room . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord said to the servant , Go out into the roads and the fields , and make them come in , so that my house may be full . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast . <EOV> <SOV> Now a great number of people went with him . <EOV> <SOV> And turning round , he said to them , If any man comes to me , and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters , and even for his life , he may not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> For which of you , desiring to put up a tower , does not first give much thought to the price , if he will have enough to make it complete ? <EOV> <SOV> For fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end , all who see it will be laughing at him , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , This man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete . <EOV> <SOV> Or what king , going to war with another king , will not first take thought if he will be strong enough , with ten thousand men , to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand ? <EOV> <SOV> Or while the other is still a great distance away , he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace . <EOV> <SOV> And so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> For salt is good , but if the taste goes from it , of what use is it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is no good for the land or for the place of waste ; no one has a use for it . He who has ears , let him give ear . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now all the tax - farmers and sinners came near to give ear to him . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees and scribes were angry , saying , This man gives approval to sinners , and takes food with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he made a story for them , saying , <EOV> <SOV> What man of you , having a hundred sheep , if one of them gets loose and goes away , will not let the ninety - nine be in the waste land by themselves , and go after the wandering one , till he sees where it is ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he has got it again , he takes it in his arms with joy . <EOV> <SOV> And when he gets back to his house , he sends for his neighbours and friends , saying to them , Be glad with me , for I have got back my sheep which had gone away . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you that even so there will be more joy in heaven when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing , than for ninety - nine good men , who have no need of a change of heart . <EOV> <SOV> Or what woman , having ten bits of silver , if one bit has gone from her hands , will not get a light , and go through her house , searching with care till she sees it ? <EOV> <SOV> And when she has it again , she gets her friends and neighbours together , saying , Be glad with me , for I have got back the bit of silver which had gone from me . <EOV> <SOV> Even so , I say to you , There is joy among the angels of God , when one sinner is turned away from his wrongdoing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A certain man had two sons : <EOV> <SOV> And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me that part of your property which will be mine . And he made division of his goods between them . <EOV> <SOV> And not long after , the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far - away country , and there all his money went in foolish living . <EOV> <SOV> And when everything was gone , there was no food to be had in that country , and he was in need . <EOV> <SOV> And he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country , and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food . <EOV> <SOV> And so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs ' food , and no one gave him anything . <EOV> <SOV> But when he came to his senses , he said , What numbers of my father 's servants have bread enough , and more , while I am near to death here through need of food ! <EOV> <SOV> I will get up and go to my father , and will say to him , Father , I have done wrong , against heaven and in your eyes : <EOV> <SOV> I am no longer good enough to be named your son : make me like one of your servants . <EOV> <SOV> And he got up and went to his father . But while he was still far away , his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss . <EOV> <SOV> And his son said to him , Father , I have done wrong , against heaven and in your eyes : I am no longer good enough to be named your son . <EOV> <SOV> But the father said to his servants , Get out the first robe quickly , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet : <EOV> <SOV> And get the fat young ox and put it to death , and let us have a feast , and be glad . <EOV> <SOV> For this , my son , who was dead , is living again ; he had gone away from me , and has come back . And they were full of joy . <EOV> <SOV> Now the older son was in the field : and when he came near the house , the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent for one of the servants , questioning him about what it might be . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Your brother has come ; and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely . <EOV> <SOV> But he was angry and would not go in ; and his father came out and made a request to him to come in . <EOV> <SOV> But he made answer and said to his father , See , all these years I have been your servant , doing your orders in everything : and you never gave me even a young goat so that I might have a feast with my friends : <EOV> <SOV> But when this your son came , who has been wasting your property with bad women , you put to death the fat young ox for him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Son , you are with me at all times , and all I have is yours . <EOV> <SOV> But it was right to be glad and to have a feast ; for this your brother , who was dead , is living again ; he had gone away and has come back . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And another time he said to the disciples , There was a certain man of great wealth who had a servant ; and it was said to him that this servant was wasting his goods . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent for him and said , What is this which is said about you ? give me an account of all you have done , for you will no longer be the manager of my property . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant said to himself , What am I to do now that my lord takes away my position ? I have not enough strength for working in the fields , and I would be shamed if I made requests for money from people in the streets . <EOV> <SOV> I have come to a decision what to do , so that when I am put out of my position they will take me into their houses . <EOV> <SOV> And sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first , What is the amount of your debt to my lord ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A hundred measures of oil . And he said , Take your account straight away and put down fifty . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said to another , What is the amount of your debt ? And he said , A hundred measures of grain . And he said to him , Take your account and put down eighty . <EOV> <SOV> And his lord was pleased with the false servant , because he had been wise ; for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , Make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life , so that when it comes to an end , you may be taken into the eternal resting - places . <EOV> <SOV> He who is true in a little , is true in much ; he who is false in small things , is false in great . <EOV> <SOV> If , then , you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life , who will give into your care the true wealth ? <EOV> <SOV> And if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people , who will give you that which is yours ? <EOV> <SOV> No man may be a servant to two masters : for he will have hate for the one and love for the other ; or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other . You may not be servants of God and of wealth . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees , who had a great love of money , hearing these things , were making sport of him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , You take care to seem right in the eyes of men , but God sees your hearts : and those things which are important in the opinion of men , are evil in the eyes of God . <EOV> <SOV> The law and the prophets were till John : but then came the preaching of the kingdom of God , and everyone makes his way into it by force . <EOV> <SOV> But heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out . <EOV> <SOV> Everyone who puts away his wife and takes another , is a false husband : and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away , is no true husband to her . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was a certain man of great wealth , who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen , and was shining and glad every day . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain poor man , named Lazarus , was stretched out at his door , full of wounds , <EOV> <SOV> Desiring the broken bits of food which came from the table of the man of wealth ; and even the dogs came and put their tongues on his wounds . <EOV> <SOV> And in time the poor man came to his end , and angels took him to Abraham 's breast . And the man of wealth came to his end , and was put in the earth . <EOV> <SOV> And in hell , being in great pain , lifting up his eyes he saw Abraham , far away , and Lazarus on his breast . <EOV> <SOV> And he gave a cry and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me and send Lazarus , so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue , for I am cruelly burning in this flame . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham said , Keep in mind , my son , that when you were living , you had your good things , while Lazarus had evil things : but now , he is comforted and you are in pain . <EOV> <SOV> And in addition , there is a deep division fixed between us and you , so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so , and no one may come from you to us . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Father , it is my request that you will send him to my father 's house ; <EOV> <SOV> For I have five brothers ; and let him give them an account of these things , so that they may not come to this place of pain . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham said , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them give ear to what they say . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , No , father Abraham , but if someone went to them from the dead , their hearts would be changed . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , If they will not give attention to Moses and the prophets , they will not be moved even if someone comes back from the dead . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said to his disciples , It is necessary for causes of trouble to come about , but unhappy is he by whom they come . <EOV> <SOV> It would be well for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea , before he made trouble for any of these little ones . <EOV> <SOV> Give attention to yourselves : if your brother does wrong , say a sharp word to him ; and if he has sorrow for his sin , let him have forgiveness . <EOV> <SOV> And if he does you wrong seven times in a day , and seven times comes to you and says , I have regret for what I have done ; let him have forgiveness . <EOV> <SOV> And the twelve said to the Lord , Make our faith greater . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , If your faith was only as great as a grain of mustard seed , you might say to this tree , Be rooted up and planted in the sea ; and it would be done . <EOV> <SOV> But which of you , having a servant who is ploughing or keeping sheep , will say to him , when he comes in from the field , Come now and be seated and have a meal , <EOV> <SOV> Will he not say , Get a meal for me , and make yourself ready and see to my needs till I have had my food and drink ; and after that you may have yours ? <EOV> <SOV> Does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered ? <EOV> <SOV> In the same way , when you have done all the things which are given you to do , say , There is no profit in us , for we have only done what we were ordered to do . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that when they were on the way to Jerusalem he went through Samaria and Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And when he went into a certain small town he came across ten men who were lepers , and they , keeping themselves at a distance , <EOV> <SOV> Said , in loud voices , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw them he said , Go , and let the priests see you . And , while they were going , they were made clean . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , when he saw that he was clean , turning back , gave praise to God in a loud voice ; <EOV> <SOV> And , falling down on his face at the feet of Jesus , he gave the credit to him ; and he was a man of Samaria . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Were there not ten men who were made clean ? where are the nine ? <EOV> <SOV> Have not any of them come back to give glory to God , but only this one from a strange land ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Get up , and go on your way ; your faith has made you well . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of God would come , he gave them an answer and said , The kingdom of God will not come through observation : <EOV> <SOV> And men will not say , See , it is here ! or , There ! for the kingdom of God is among you . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to his disciples , The time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , but you will not see it . <EOV> <SOV> And if they say to you , See , it is there ! or , It is here ! do not go away , or go after them . <EOV> <SOV> For as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other , so will the Son of man be when his time comes . <EOV> <SOV> But first , he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And as it was in the days of Noah , so will it be in the day of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> They were feasting and taking wives and getting married , till the day of the overflowing of the waters , when Noah went into the ark , and they all came to destruction . <EOV> <SOV> In the same way , in the days of Lot ; they were feasting and trading , they were planting and building ; <EOV> <SOV> But on the day when Lot went out of Sodom , fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all . <EOV> <SOV> So will it be in the day of the revelation of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> On that day , if anyone is on the roof of the house , and his goods are in the house , let him not go down to take them away ; and let him who is in the field not go back to his house . <EOV> <SOV> Keep in mind Lot 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> If anyone makes an attempt to keep his life , it will be taken from him , but if anyone gives up his life , he will keep it . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , In that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed , and one will be taken away and the other let go . <EOV> <SOV> Two women will be crushing grain together ; one will be taken away and the other let go . <EOV> <SOV> [ ] <EOV> <SOV> And they , answering him , said , Where , Lord ? And he said to them , Where the body is , there will the eagles come together . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he made a story for them , the point of which was that men were to go on making prayer and not get tired ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying , There was a judge in a certain town , who had no fear of God or respect for man : <EOV> <SOV> And there was a widow in that town , and she kept on coming to him and saying , Give me my right against the man who has done me wrong . <EOV> <SOV> And for a time he would not : but later , he said to himself , Though I have no fear of God or respect for man , <EOV> <SOV> Because this widow is a trouble to me , I will give her her right ; for if not , I will be completely tired out by her frequent coming . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Give ear to the words of the evil judge . <EOV> <SOV> And will not God do right in the cause of his saints , whose cries come day and night to his ears , though he is long in doing it ? <EOV> <SOV> I say to you that he will quickly do right in their cause . But when the Son of man comes , will there be any faith on earth ? <EOV> <SOV> And he made this story for some people who were certain that they were good , and had a low opinion of others : <EOV> <SOV> Two men went up to the Temple for prayer ; one a Pharisee , and the other a tax - farmer . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisee , taking up his position , said to himself these words : God , I give you praise because I am not like other men , who take more than their right , who are evil - doers , who are untrue to their wives , or even like this tax - farmer . <EOV> <SOV> Twice in the week I go without food ; I give a tenth of all I have . <EOV> <SOV> The tax - farmer , on the other hand , keeping far away , and not lifting up even his eyes to heaven , made signs of grief and said , God , have mercy on me , a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , This man went back to his house with God 's approval , and not the other : for everyone who makes himself high will be made low and whoever makes himself low will be made high . <EOV> <SOV> And they took their children to him , so that he might put his hands on them : but when the disciples saw it , they said sharp words to them <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus sent for them , saying , Let the children come to me , and do not keep them away , for of such is the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Truly I say to you , Whoever does not put himself under the kingdom of God like a little child , will not come into it at all . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain ruler put a question to him , saying , Good Master , what have I to do so that I may have eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Why do you say that I am good ? No one is good , but only God . <EOV> <SOV> You have knowledge of what the law says : Do not be untrue to your wife , Do not put anyone to death , Do not take what is not yours , Do not give false witness , Give honour to your father and mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , All these things I have done from the time when I was a boy . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , hearing it , said to him , One thing you still have need of ; get money for your goods , and give it away to the poor , and you will have wealth in heaven ; and come after me . <EOV> <SOV> But at these words he became very sad , for he had great wealth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , looking at him , said , How hard it is for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> It is simpler for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a man who has much money to come into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And those who were present said , Then who may have salvation ? <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Things which are not possible with man are possible with God . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , See , we have given up what is ours to come after you . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Truly I say to you , There is no man who has given up house or wife or brothers or father or mother or children , because of the kingdom of God , <EOV> <SOV> Who will not get much more in this time , and in the world to come , eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> And he took with him the twelve and said to them , Now we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things which were said by the prophets will be done to the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> For he will be given up to the Gentiles , and will be made sport of and put to shame : <EOV> <SOV> And he will be given cruel blows and put to death , and on the third day he will come back to life . <EOV> <SOV> But they did not take in the sense of any of these words , and what he said was not clear to them , and their minds were not able to see it . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that when he got near Jericho , a certain blind man was seated by the side of the road , making requests for money from those who went by . <EOV> <SOV> And hearing the sound of a great number of people going by , he said , What is this ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Jesus of Nazareth is going by . <EOV> <SOV> And he said in a loud voice , Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And those who were in front made protests and said to him , Be quiet : but he said all the more , O Son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , stopping , gave orders that he was to come to him , and when he came near , he said to him , <EOV> <SOV> What would you have me do for you ? And he said , Lord , that I may be able to see again . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , See again : your faith has made you well . <EOV> <SOV> And straight away he was able to see , and he went after him , giving glory to God ; and all the people when they saw it gave praise to God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he went into Jericho , and when he was going through it , <EOV> <SOV> A man , named Zacchaeus , who was the chief tax - farmer , and a man of wealth , <EOV> <SOV> Made an attempt to get a view of Jesus , and was not able to do so , because of the people , for he was a small man . <EOV> <SOV> And he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him , for he was going that way . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus came to the place , looking up , he said to him , Zacchaeus , be quick and come down , for I am coming to your house today . <EOV> <SOV> And he came down quickly , and took him into his house with joy . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw it , they were all angry , saying , He has gone into the house of a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacchaeus , waiting before him , said to the Lord , See , Lord , half of my goods I give to the poor , and if I have taken anything from anyone wrongly , I give him back four times as much . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Today salvation has come to this house , for even he is a son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way , and to be their Saviour . <EOV> <SOV> And while they were giving ear to these words , he made another story for them , because he was near Jerusalem , and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of God was coming straight away . <EOV> <SOV> So he said , A certain man of high birth went into a far - away country to get a kingdom for himself , and to come back . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them , Do business with this till I come . <EOV> <SOV> But his people had no love for him , and sent representatives after him , saying , We will not have this man for our ruler . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came back again , having got his kingdom , he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him , so that he might have an account of what business they had done . <EOV> <SOV> And the first came before him , saying , Lord , your pound has made ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , You have done well , O good servant : because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns . <EOV> <SOV> And another came , saying , Your pound has made five pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , You will be ruler over five towns . <EOV> <SOV> And another came , saying , Lord , here is your pound , which I put away in a cloth ; <EOV> <SOV> Because I was in fear of you , for you are a hard man : you take up what you have not put down , and get in grain where you have not put seed . <EOV> <SOV> He said to him , By the words of your mouth you will be judged , you bad servant . You had knowledge that I am a hard man , taking up what I have not put down and getting in grain where I have not put seed ; <EOV> <SOV> Why then did you not put my money in a bank , so that when I came I would get it back with interest ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the others who were near , Take the pound away from him , and give it to the man who has ten . <EOV> <SOV> And they say to him , Lord , he has ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you that to everyone who has , more will be given , but from him who has not , even what he has will be taken away . <EOV> <SOV> And as for those who were against me , who would not have me for their ruler , let them come here , and be put to death before me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , he went on in front of them , going up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And it came about that when he got near Beth - phage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives , he sent two of the disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Go into the little town in front of you , and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord , on which no man has ever been seated ; let him loose and take him . <EOV> <SOV> And if anyone says to you , Why are you taking him ? say , The Lord has need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And those whom he sent went away , and it was as he said . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were getting the young ass , the owners of it said to them , Why are you taking the young ass ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , The Lord has need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they took him to Jesus , and they put their clothing on the ass , and Jesus got on to him . <EOV> <SOV> And while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came near the foot of the Mountain of Olives , all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to God with joy , because of all the great works which they had seen ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying , A blessing on the King who comes in the name of the Lord ; peace in heaven and glory in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Pharisees among the people said to him , Master , make your disciples be quiet . <EOV> <SOV> And he said in answer , I say to you , if these men keep quiet , the very stones will be crying out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he got near and saw the town , he was overcome with weeping for it , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , If you , even you , had knowledge today , of the things which give peace ! but you are not able to see them . <EOV> <SOV> For the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you , and come all round you and keep you in on every side , <EOV> <SOV> And will make you level with the earth , and your children with you ; and there will not be one stone resting on another in you , because you did not see that it was your day of mercy . <EOV> <SOV> And he went into the Temple and put out those who were trading there , <EOV> <SOV> Saying to them , It has been said , My house is to be a house of prayer , but you have made it a hole of thieves . <EOV> <SOV> And every day he was teaching in the Temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death ; <EOV> <SOV> But they were not able to do anything , because the people all kept near him , being greatly interested in his words . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came about on one of those days , when he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the good news , <EOV> <SOV> That the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said , Make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority . <EOV> <SOV> And in answer he said to them , I will put a question to you , and do you give me an answer : <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it from heaven or of men ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said among themselves , If we say , From heaven ; he will say , Why did you not have faith in him ? <EOV> <SOV> But if we say , Of men ; we will be stoned by the people , for they are certain that John was a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they made answer that they had no idea where it came from . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he gave the people this story : A man made a vine - garden and gave the use of it to some field - workers and went into another country for a long time . <EOV> <SOV> And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines ; but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent another servant , and they gave blows to him in the same way , and put shame on him , and sent him away with nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent a third , and they gave him wounds and put him out . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord of the garden said , What am I to do ? I will send my dearly loved son ; they may give respect to him . <EOV> <SOV> But when the workmen saw him , they said to one another , This is he who will one day be the owner of the property : let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours . <EOV> <SOV> And driving him out of the garden they put him to death . Now what will the lord do to these workmen ? <EOV> <SOV> He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others . And when he said this , they said , May it not be so . <EOV> <SOV> But he , looking on them , said , Is it not in the Writings , The stone which the builders put on one side , the same has become the chief stone of the building ? <EOV> <SOV> Everyone falling on that stone will be broken , but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour ; and they were in fear of the people , for they saw that he had made up this story against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they kept watch on him , and sent out secret representatives , who were acting the part of good men , in order that they might get something from his words , on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler . <EOV> <SOV> And they put a question to him , saying , Master , we are certain that your teaching and your words are right , and that you have no respect for a man 's position , but you are teaching the true way of God : <EOV> <SOV> Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But he saw through their trick and said to them , <EOV> <SOV> Let me see a penny . Whose image and name are on it ? And they said , Caesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesar 's , and to God the things which are God 's . <EOV> <SOV> And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people : but they were full of wonder at his answer , and said nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Sadducees came to him , who say that there is no coming back from the dead ; and they said to him , <EOV> <SOV> Master , Moses said that if a man 's brother comes to his end , having a wife , but no children , his brother is to take the wife , and get a family for his brother . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were seven brothers , and the first had a wife and came to his end , having no children ; <EOV> <SOV> And the second ; <EOV> <SOV> And the third took her ; and in the same way , all the seven , without having any children , came to their end . <EOV> <SOV> And last of all , the woman came to her end . <EOV> <SOV> When they come back from the dead , whose wife will she be ? for all the seven had her . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , The sons of this world are married and have wives ; <EOV> <SOV> But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come , and to come back from the dead , have no wives , and are not married ; <EOV> <SOV> And death has no more power over them , for they are equal to the angels , and are sons of God , being of those who will come back from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life , saying , in the story of the burning thorn - tree , The Lord , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . <EOV> <SOV> Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living : for all men are living to him . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the scribes , in answer to this , said , Master , you have said well . <EOV> <SOV> And they had fear of putting any more questions to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> For David himself says in the book of Psalms , The Lord said to my Lord , Take your seat at my right hand , <EOV> <SOV> Till I put under your feet all those who are against you . <EOV> <SOV> David then gives him the name of Lord , so how is it possible for him to be his son ? <EOV> <SOV> And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Keep away from the scribes , whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes , and to have words of respect said to them in the market - places , and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts ; <EOV> <SOV> Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers ; they will get a greater punishment . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And looking up , he saw the men of wealth putting their offerings in the money - box . <EOV> <SOV> And he saw a certain poor widow putting in a farthing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Truly I say to you , This poor widow has given more than all of them : <EOV> <SOV> For they gave out of their wealth , having more than enough for themselves : but she , even out of her need , has put in all her living . <EOV> <SOV> And some were talking about the Temple , how it was made fair with beautiful stones and with offerings , but he said , <EOV> <SOV> As for these things which you see , the days will come when not one stone will be resting on another , but all will be broken down . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Master , when will these things be ? and what sign will there be when these events are to take place ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Take care that you are not tricked : for a number of people will come in my name , saying , I am he ; and , The time is near : do not go after them . <EOV> <SOV> And when news of wars and troubled times comes to your ears , have no fear ; for these things have to be , but the end will not be now . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said to them , Nation will be moved against nation and kingdom against kingdom : <EOV> <SOV> There will be great earth - shocks and outbursts of disease in a number of places , and men will be without food ; and there will be wonders and great signs from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But before all this , they will take you and be very cruel to you , giving you up to the Synagogues and to prisons , taking you before kings and rulers , because of my name . <EOV> <SOV> And it will be turned to a witness for you . <EOV> <SOV> So take care not to be troubled before the time comes , about what answers you will give : <EOV> <SOV> For I will give you words and wisdom , so that not one of those who are against you will be able to get the better of you , or to put you in the wrong . <EOV> <SOV> But you will be given up even by your fathers and mothers , your brothers and relations and friends ; and some of you will be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And you will be hated by all men , because of me . <EOV> <SOV> But not a hair of your head will come to destruction . <EOV> <SOV> By going through all these things , you will keep your lives . <EOV> <SOV> But when you see armies all round about Jerusalem , then be certain that her destruction is near . <EOV> <SOV> Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains ; and those who are in the middle of the town go out ; and let not those who are in the country come in . <EOV> <SOV> For these are the days of punishment , in which all the things in the Writings will be put into effect . <EOV> <SOV> It will be hard for women who are with child , and for her with a baby at the breast , in those days . For great trouble will come on the land , and wrath on this people . <EOV> <SOV> And they will be put to death with the sword , and will be taken as prisoners into all the nations ; and Jerusalem will be crushed under the feet of the Gentiles , till the times of the Gentiles are complete . <EOV> <SOV> And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars ; and on the earth , fear among the nations and doubt because of the loud noise of the sea and the waves ; <EOV> <SOV> Men 's strength will go from them in fear and in waiting for the things which are coming on the earth ; for the powers of the heavens will be moved . <EOV> <SOV> And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud , with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> But when these things come about , let your heads be lifted up , because your salvation is near . <EOV> <SOV> And he made a story for them : See the fig - tree , and all the trees ; <EOV> <SOV> When they put out their young leaves , you take note of it , and it is clear to you that summer is coming . <EOV> <SOV> In the same way , when you see these things taking place you may be certain that the kingdom of God is near . <EOV> <SOV> Truly I say to you , This generation will not come to an end till all things are complete . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth will come to an end , but my words will not come to an end . <EOV> <SOV> But give attention to yourselves , for fear that your hearts become over - full of the pleasures of food and wine , and the cares of this life , and that day may come on you suddenly , and take you as in a net : <EOV> <SOV> For so it will come on all those who are living on the face of all the earth . <EOV> <SOV> But keep watch at all times with prayer , that you may be strong enough to come through all these things and take your place before the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> And every day he was teaching in the Temple and every night he went out to the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives to take his rest . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people came early in the morning to give ear to his words in the Temple . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now the feast of unleavened bread was near , which is called the Passover . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes were looking for a chance to put him to death , but they went in fear of the people . <EOV> <SOV> And Satan came into Judas Iscariot , who was one of the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And he went away and had a discussion with the chief priests and the rulers , about how he might give him up to them . <EOV> <SOV> And they were glad , and undertook to give him money . <EOV> <SOV> And he made an agreement with them to give him up to them , if he got a chance , when the people were not present . <EOV> <SOV> And the day of unleavened bread came , when the Passover lamb is put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus sent Peter and John , saying , Go and make the Passover ready for us , so that we may take it . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Where are we to get it ready ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , When you go into the town you will see a man coming to you with a vessel of water ; go after him into the house into which he goes . <EOV> <SOV> And say to the master of the house , The Master says , Where is the guest - room , where I may take the Passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And he will take you up to a great room with a table and seats : there make ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they went , and it was as he had said : and they made the Passover ready . <EOV> <SOV> And when the time had come , he took his seat , and the Apostles with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I have had a great desire to keep this Passover with you before I come to my death ; <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , I will not take it till it is made complete in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he took a cup and , having given praise , he said , Make division of this among yourselves ; <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , I will not take of the fruit of the vine till the kingdom of God has come . <EOV> <SOV> And he took bread and , having given praise , he gave it to them when it had been broken , saying , This is my body , which is given for you : do this in memory of me . <EOV> <SOV> And in the same way , after the meal , he took the cup , saying , This cup is the new testament , made with my blood which is given for you . <EOV> <SOV> But the hand of him who is false to me is with me at the table . <EOV> <SOV> For it will be done to the Son of man after the purpose of God , but unhappy is that man by whom he is given up . <EOV> <SOV> And they were wondering among themselves which of them it was who would do this thing . <EOV> <SOV> And there was an argument among them about which of them was the greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , The kings of the Gentiles are lords over them , and those who have authority are given names of honour . <EOV> <SOV> But let it not be so with you ; but he who is greater , let him become like the younger ; and he who is chief , like a servant . <EOV> <SOV> For which is greater , the guest who is seated at a meal or the servant who is waiting on him ? is it not the guest ? but I am among you as a servant . <EOV> <SOV> But you are those who have kept with me through my troubles ; <EOV> <SOV> And I will give you a kingdom as my Father has given one to me , <EOV> <SOV> So that you may take food and drink at my table in my kingdom , and be seated like kings , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Simon , Simon , Satan has made a request to have you , so that he may put you to the test as grain is tested : <EOV> <SOV> But I have made prayer for you , that your faith may not go from you : and when you are turned again , make your brothers strong . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Lord , I am ready to go with you to prison and to death . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I say to you , Peter , before the cock 's second cry today , you will say three times that you have no knowledge of me . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , When I sent you out without money or bag or shoes , were you in need of anything ? And they said , Nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , But now , he who has a money - bag , or a bag for food , let him take it : and he who has not , let him give his coat for money and get a sword . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you that these words will be put into effect in me , And he was numbered among the evil - doers : for what has been said in the Writings about me has an end . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Lord , here are two swords . And he said , It is enough . <EOV> <SOV> And he came out , and went , as his way was , to the Mountain of Olives , and the disciples went with him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to the place , he said to them , Make a prayer that you may not be put to the test . <EOV> <SOV> And he went a little distance away from them and , falling on his knees in prayer , he said , <EOV> <SOV> Father , if it is your pleasure , take this cup from me : but still , let your pleasure , not mine , be done . <EOV> <SOV> And an angel from heaven came to him , to give him strength . <EOV> <SOV> And being in great trouble of soul , the force of his prayer became stronger , and great drops , like blood , came from him , falling to the earth . <EOV> <SOV> And , getting up from prayer , he came to the disciples , and saw that they were sleeping for sorrow . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Why are you sleeping ? Get up , and give yourselves to prayer , so that you may not be put to the test . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was saying these words , there came a band of people , and Judas , one of the twelve , was in front of them , and he came near to Jesus to give him a kiss . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Judas , will you be false to the Son of man with a kiss ? <EOV> <SOV> And when those who were with him saw what was coming , they said , Lord , may we not make use of our swords ? <EOV> <SOV> And one of them gave a blow to the servant of the high priest , cutting off his right ear . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , answering , said , Put up with this , at least . And touching his ear , he made it well . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to the chief priests and the captains of the Temple and the rulers , who had come against him , Have you come out as against a thief , with swords and sticks ? <EOV> <SOV> When I was in the Temple with you every day , your hands were not stretched out against me : but this is your hour , and the authority of the dark power . <EOV> <SOV> And they made him a prisoner and took him away to the house of the high priest . But Peter went after them at a distance . <EOV> <SOV> And a fire was lighted in the middle of the open square , and they were seated together , and Peter was among them . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain woman - servant , seeing him in the light of the fire , and looking at him with attention , said , This man was with him . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Woman , it is not true ; I have no knowledge of him . <EOV> <SOV> And after a little time , another saw him and said , You are one of them ; and he said , Man , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> And after about an hour , another man said , with decision , Certainly this man was with him , for he is a Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , Man , I have no knowledge of these things of which you are talking . And straight away , while he was saying these words , there came the cry of a cock . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord , turning , gave Peter a look . And the words of the Lord came to Peter 's mind , how he had said , This night , before the hour of the cock 's cry , you will be false to me three times . <EOV> <SOV> And he went out , weeping bitterly . <EOV> <SOV> And the men in whose hands Jesus was , made sport of him and gave him blows . <EOV> <SOV> And , covering his eyes , they said to him , Are you prophet enough to say who gave you that blow ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said a number of other evil things against him . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , the rulers of the people came together , with the chief priests and the scribes , and they took him before their Sanhedrin , saying , <EOV> <SOV> If you are the Christ , say so . But he said , If I say so you will not have belief ; <EOV> <SOV> And if I put a question to you , you will not give an answer . <EOV> <SOV> But in the future the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they all said , Are you then the Son of God ? and he said , You say that I am . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , What more need have we of witness ? we have the very words of his mouth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And they all went and took him before Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And they made statements against him , saying , This man has to our knowledge been teaching our nation to do wrong , and not to make payment of taxes to Caesar , even saying that he himself is Christ , a king . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said to him , Are you the King of the Jews ? And he said in answer , You say so . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said to the chief priests and the people , In my opinion this man has done no wrong . <EOV> <SOV> But they became more violent than before , saying , He has made trouble among the people , teaching through all Judaea from Galilee to this place . <EOV> <SOV> But at these words Pilate said , Is the man a Galilaean ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw that he was under the authority of Herod , he sent him to Herod , who was in Jerusalem himself at that time . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Herod saw Jesus he was very glad , having for a long time had a desire to see him , for he had had accounts of him , and was hoping to see some wonders done by him . <EOV> <SOV> And he put a great number of questions to him , but he said nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes were there , making statements against him violently . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod , with the men of his army , put shame on him and made sport of him , and dressing him in shining robes , he sent him back to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And that day Herod and Pilate became friends with one another , for before they had been against one another . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate sent for the chief priests and the rulers and the people , and said to them , <EOV> <SOV> You say that this man has been teaching the people evil things : now I , after going into the question before you , see nothing wrong in this man in connection with the things which you have said against him : <EOV> <SOV> And Herod is of the same opinion , for he has sent him back to us ; for , you see , he has done nothing for which I might put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> And so I will give him punishment and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> [ ] <EOV> <SOV> But with loud voices they said all together , Put this man to death , and make Barabbas free . <EOV> <SOV> Now this man was in prison because of an attack against the government in the town , in which there had been loss of life . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate again said to them that it was his desire to let Jesus go free . <EOV> <SOV> But crying out they said , To the cross with him ! <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them a third time , Why , what evil has he done ? I see no reason for putting him to death : I will give him punishment and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> But they went on crying out loudly , Let him be put to death on the cross . And they had their way . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate gave his decision for their desire to be put into effect . <EOV> <SOV> And in answer to their request , he let that man go free who had been in prison for acting against the government and causing death , and Jesus he gave up to their pleasure . <EOV> <SOV> And while they were taking him away , they put their hands on Simon of Cyrene , who was coming from the country , and made him take the cross after Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And a great band of people went after him , and of women making signs of grief and weeping for him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , turning to them , said , Daughters of Jerusalem , let not your weeping be for me , but for yourselves and for your children . <EOV> <SOV> For the days are coming in which they will say , Happy are those who have had no children , whose bodies have never given birth , whose breasts have never given milk . <EOV> <SOV> And they will say to the mountains , Come down on us , and to the hills , Be a cover over us . <EOV> <SOV> For if they do these things when the tree is green , what will they do when it is dry ? <EOV> <SOV> And two others , evil - doers , were taken with him to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came to the place which is named Golgotha , they put him on the cross , and the evil - doers , one on the right side , and the other on the left . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Father , let them have forgiveness , for they have no knowledge of what they are doing . And they made division of his clothing among them by the decision of chance . <EOV> <SOV> And the people were looking on . And the rulers made sport of him , saying , He was a saviour of others ; let him do something for himself , if he is the Christ , the man of God 's selection . <EOV> <SOV> And the men of the army made sport of him , coming to him and giving him bitter wine , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , If you are the King of the Jews , get yourself free . <EOV> <SOV> And these words were put in writing over him , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the evil - doers on the cross , with bitter feeling , said to him , Are you not the Christ ? Get yourself and us out of this . <EOV> <SOV> But the other , protesting , said , Have you no fear of God ? for you have a part in the same punishment , <EOV> <SOV> And with reason ; for we have the right reward of our acts , but this man has done nothing wrong . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Jesus , keep me in mind when you come in your kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Truly I say to you , Today you will be with me in Paradise . <EOV> <SOV> And it was now about the sixth hour ; and all the land was dark till the ninth hour ; <EOV> <SOV> The light of the sun went out , and the curtain in the Temple was parted in two . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus gave a loud cry and said , Father , into your hands I give my spirit : and when he had said this , he gave up his spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And when the captain saw what was done , he gave praise to God , saying , Without doubt this was an upright man . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people who had come together to see it , when they saw the things which were done , went back again making signs of grief . <EOV> <SOV> And all his friends and the women who came with him from Galilee , were waiting at a distance , watching these things . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was a man named Joseph , a man of authority and a good and upright man <EOV> <SOV> ( He had not given his approval to their decision or their acts ) , of Arimathaea , a town of the Jews , who was waiting for the kingdom of God : <EOV> <SOV> This man went to Pilate and made a request for the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And he took it down , and folding it in a linen cloth , he put it in a place cut in the rock for a dead body ; and no one had ever been put in it . <EOV> <SOV> Now it was the day of making ready and the Sabbath was coming on . <EOV> <SOV> And the women who had come with him from Galilee went after him and saw the place and how his body had been put to rest ; <EOV> <SOV> And they went back and got ready spices and perfumes ; and on the Sabbath they took their rest , in agreement with the law . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But on the first day of the week , at dawn , they came to the place where his body had been put , taking the spices which they had got ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they saw that the stone had been rolled away . <EOV> <SOV> And they went in , but the body of the Lord Jesus was not there . <EOV> <SOV> And while they were in doubt about it , they saw two men in shining clothing by them : <EOV> <SOV> And while their faces were bent down to the earth in fear , these said to them , Why are you looking for the living among the dead ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not here , he has come back to life : have in mind what he said to you when he was still in Galilee , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man will be given up into the hands of evil - doers , and be put to death on the cross , and on the third day he will come back to life . <EOV> <SOV> And his words came back into their minds , <EOV> <SOV> And they went away from that place and gave an account of all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others . <EOV> <SOV> Now they were Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary , the mother of James : and the other women with them said these things to the Apostles . <EOV> <SOV> But these words seemed foolish to them , and they had no belief in them . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter got up and went to the place where the body had been put , and looking in he saw nothing but the linen cloths , and he went to his house full of wonder at what had taken place . <EOV> <SOV> And then , two of them , on that very day , were going to a little town named Emmaus , which was about seven miles from Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And they were talking together about all those things which had taken place . <EOV> <SOV> And while they were talking and questioning together , Jesus himself came near and went with them . <EOV> <SOV> But their eyes were not open that they might have knowledge of him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What are you talking about together while you go ? <EOV> <SOV> Then stopping , and looking sadly at him , one of them , named Cleopas , said to him , Are you the only man living in Jerusalem who has not had news of the things which have taken place there at this time ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What things ? And they said , The things to do with Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet , great in his acts and his words , before God and all the people : <EOV> <SOV> And how the chief priests and our rulers gave him up to be put to death on the cross . <EOV> <SOV> But we were hoping that he would be the Saviour of Israel . In addition to all this he has now let three days go by from the time when these things took place ; <EOV> <SOV> And certain women among us gave us cause for wonder , for they went early to the place where his body had been put , <EOV> <SOV> And it was not there ; then they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he was living . <EOV> <SOV> And some of those who were with us went to the place , and saw that it was as the women had said , but him they did not see . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , O foolish men ! how slow you are to give belief to what the prophets have said . <EOV> <SOV> Was it not necessary for the Christ to go through these things , and to come into his glory ? <EOV> <SOV> And he made clear to them all the things in the Writings , from Moses and from all the prophets , which had to do with himself . <EOV> <SOV> And they came near the town to which they were going , and he seemed as if he was going on ; <EOV> <SOV> But they kept him back , saying , Do not go , for evening is near , the day is almost gone . And he went in with them . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was seated with them at table , he took the bread , and said words of blessing and , making division of it , he gave it to them . <EOV> <SOV> And then their eyes were open , and they had knowledge of him , but he went from their view . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to one another , Were not our hearts burning in us while he was talking to us on the way , making clear to us the holy Writings ? <EOV> <SOV> And that very hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem , where the eleven and the others had come together . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to them , The Lord has truly come back to life again , and Simon has seen him . <EOV> <SOV> And they gave an account of the things which had taken place on the way , and how , when he gave them bread , they had knowledge of him . <EOV> <SOV> And while they were saying these things , he himself was among them , and said to them , Peace be with you ! <EOV> <SOV> But they were full of fear , being of the opinion that they were seeing a spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why are you troubled , and why are your hearts full of doubt ? <EOV> <SOV> See ; my hands and my feet : it is I myself ; put your hands on me and make certain ; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , he let them see his hands and his feet . <EOV> <SOV> And because , for joy and wonder , they were still in doubt , he said to them , Have you any food here ? <EOV> <SOV> And they gave him a bit of cooked fish . <EOV> <SOV> And before their eyes he took a meal . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , These are the words which I said to you when I was still with you , how it was necessary for all the things which are in the writings of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms about me , to be put into effect . <EOV> <SOV> Then he made the holy Writings clear to their minds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , So it is in the Writings that the Christ would undergo death , and come back to life again on the third day ; <EOV> <SOV> And that teaching about a change of heart and forgiveness of sins is to be given to Jerusalem first and to all nations in his name . <EOV> <SOV> You are witnesses of these things . <EOV> <SOV> And now I will send to you what my father has undertaken to give you , but do not go from the town , till the power from heaven comes to you . <EOV> <SOV> And he took them out till they were near Bethany , and lifting up his hands , he gave them a blessing . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was doing so , he went from them and was taken up into heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they gave him worship and went back to Jerusalem with great joy . <EOV> <SOV> And they were in the Temple at all times , giving praise to God . <EOV> <EOC>
