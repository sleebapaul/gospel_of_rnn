<SOC> <SOV> Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ , Son of God ; <EOV> <SOV> as it is written in [ Isaiah ] the prophet , Behold , * I * send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way . <EOV> <SOV> Voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare the way of [ the ] Lord , make his paths straight . <EOV> <SOV> There came John baptising in the wilderness , and preaching [ the ] baptism of repentance for remission of sins . <EOV> <SOV> And there went out to him all the district of Judaea , and all they of Jerusalem , and were baptised by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> And John was clothed in camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins , and ate locusts and wild honey . <EOV> <SOV> And he preached , saying , There comes he that is mightier than I after me , the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose . <EOV> <SOV> * I * indeed have baptised you with water , but * he * shall baptise you with [ the ] Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days [ that ] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptised by John at the Jordan . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway going up from the water , he saw the heavens parting asunder , and the Spirit , as a dove , descending upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a voice out of the heavens : * Thou * art my beloved Son , in thee I have found my delight . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness . <EOV> <SOV> And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan , and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered to him . <EOV> <SOV> But after John was delivered up , Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh ; repent and believe in the glad tidings . <EOV> <SOV> And walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon , and Andrew , [ Simon 's ] brother , casting out a net in the sea , for they were fishers . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Come after me , and I will make you become fishers of men ; <EOV> <SOV> and straightway leaving their trawl - nets they followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And going on thence a little , he saw James the [ son ] of Zebedee , and John his brother , and these [ were ] in the ship repairing the trawl - nets ; <EOV> <SOV> and straightway he called them ; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , they went away after him . <EOV> <SOV> And they go into Capernaum . And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished at his doctrine , for he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes . <EOV> <SOV> And there was in their synagogue a man [ possessed ] by an unclean spirit , and he cried out <EOV> <SOV> saying , Eh ! what have we to do with thee , Jesus , Nazarene ? Art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the holy one of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace and come out of him . <EOV> <SOV> And the unclean spirit , having torn him , and uttered a cry with a loud voice , came out of him . <EOV> <SOV> And all were amazed , so that they questioned together among themselves , saying , What is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . <EOV> <SOV> And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway going out of the synagogue , they came with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew . <EOV> <SOV> And the mother - in - law of Simon lay in a fever . And straightway they speak to him about her . <EOV> <SOV> And he went up to [ her ] and raised her up , having taken her by the hand , and straightway the fever left her , and she served them . <EOV> <SOV> But evening being come , when the sun had gone down , they brought to him all that were suffering , and those possessed by demons ; <EOV> <SOV> and the whole city was gathered together at the door . <EOV> <SOV> And he healed many suffering from various diseases ; and he cast out many demons , and did not suffer the demons to speak because they knew him . <EOV> <SOV> And rising in the morning long before day , he went out and went away into a desert place , and there prayed . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon and those with him went after him : <EOV> <SOV> and having found him , they say to him , All seek thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns , that I may preach there also , for for this purpose am I come forth . <EOV> <SOV> And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee , and casting out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And there comes to him a leper , beseeching him , and falling on his knees to him , and saying to him , If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , moved with compassion , having stretched out his hand , touched him , and says to him , I will , be thou cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him , and he was cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And having sharply charged him , he straightway sent him away , <EOV> <SOV> and says to him , See thou say nothing to any one , but go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained , for a testimony to them . <EOV> <SOV> But he , having gone forth , began to proclaim [ it ] much , and to spread the matter abroad , so that he could no longer enter openly into the city , but was without in desert places , and they came to him from every side . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered again into Capernaum after [ several ] days , and it was reported that he was at [ the ] house ; <EOV> <SOV> and straightway many were gathered together , so that there was no longer any room , not even at the door ; and he spoke the word to them . <EOV> <SOV> And there come to him [ men ] bringing a paralytic , borne by four ; <EOV> <SOV> and , not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd , they uncovered the roof where he was , and having dug [ it ] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , seeing their faith , says to the paralytic , Child , thy sins are forgiven [ thee ] . <EOV> <SOV> But certain of the scribes were there sitting , and reasoning in their hearts , <EOV> <SOV> Why does this [ man ] thus speak ? he blasphemes . Who is able to forgive sins except God alone ? <EOV> <SOV> And straightway Jesus , knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves , said to them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , [ Thy ] sins are forgiven [ thee ] ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy couch and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins , he says to the paralytic , <EOV> <SOV> To thee I say , Arise , take up thy couch and go to thine house . <EOV> <SOV> And he rose up straightway , and , having taken up his couch , went out before [ them ] all , so that all were amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it thus . <EOV> <SOV> And he went out again by the sea , and all the crowd came to him , and he taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And passing by , he saw Levi the [ son ] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax - office , and says to him , Follow me . And he rose up and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house , that many tax - gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples ; for they were many , and they followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees , seeing him eating with sinners and tax - gatherers , said to his disciples , Why [ is it ] that he eats and drinks with tax - gatherers and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having heard [ it ] says to them , They that are strong have not need of a physician , but those who are ill . I have not come to call righteous [ men ] , but sinners . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting ; and they come and say to him , Why do the disciples of John and [ the disciples ] of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Can the sons of the bride - chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they can not fast . <EOV> <SOV> But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them , and then shall they fast in that day . <EOV> <SOV> No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment : otherwise its new filling - up takes from the old [ stuff ] , and there is a worse rent . <EOV> <SOV> And no one puts new wine into old skins ; otherwise the wine bursts the skins , and the wine is poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but new wine is to be put into new skins . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields ; and his disciples began to walk on , plucking the ears . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees said to him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful ? <EOV> <SOV> And * he * said to them , Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered , * he * and those with him , <EOV> <SOV> how he entered into the house of God , in [ the section of ] Abiathar [ the ] high priest , and ate the shew - bread , which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat , and gave even to those that were with him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , The sabbath was made on account of man , not man on account of the sabbath ; <EOV> <SOV> so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was there a man having his hand dried up . <EOV> <SOV> And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath , that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to the man who had his hand dried up , Rise up [ and come ] into the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil , to save life or to kill ? But they were silent . <EOV> <SOV> And looking round upon them with anger , distressed at the hardening of their heart , he says to the man , Stretch out thy hand . And he stretched [ it ] out , and his hand was restored . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him , how they might destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea ; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea , <EOV> <SOV> and from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan ; and they of around Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , having heard what things he did , came to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke to his disciples , in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd , that they might not press upon him . <EOV> <SOV> For he healed many , so that they beset him that they might touch him , as many as had plagues . <EOV> <SOV> And the unclean spirits , when they beheld him , fell down before him , and cried saying , * Thou * art the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he rebuked them much , that they might not make him manifest . <EOV> <SOV> And he goes up into the mountain , and calls whom he himself would , and they went to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he appointed twelve that they might be with him , and that he might send them to preach , <EOV> <SOV> and to have power [ to heal diseases , and ] to cast out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter ; <EOV> <SOV> and James the [ son ] of Zebedee , and John the brother of James , and he gave them the surname of Boanerges , that is , Sons of thunder ; <EOV> <SOV> and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the [ son ] of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Cananaean , <EOV> <SOV> and Judas Iscariote , who also delivered him up . And they come to [ the ] house . <EOV> <SOV> And again a crowd comes together , so that they can not even eat bread . <EOV> <SOV> And his relatives having heard [ of it ] went out to lay hold on him , for they said , He is out of his mind . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said , He has Beelzebub , and , By the prince of the demons he casts out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And having called them to [ him ] , he said to them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ? <EOV> <SOV> And if a kingdom has become divided against itself , that kingdom can not subsist . <EOV> <SOV> And if a house has become divided against itself , that house can not subsist . <EOV> <SOV> And if Satan rise up against himself , and is divided , he can not subsist , but has an end . <EOV> <SOV> But no one can , having entered into his house , plunder the goods of the strong [ man ] unless he first bind the strong [ man ] , and then he will plunder his house . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men , and all the injurious speeches [ with ] which they may speak injuriously ; <EOV> <SOV> but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit , to eternity has no forgiveness ; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin ; <EOV> <SOV> -- because they said , He has an unclean spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And his brethren and his mother come , and standing without sent to him calling him . <EOV> <SOV> And a crowd sat around him . And they said to him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother or my brethren ? <EOV> <SOV> And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him , he says , Behold my mother and my brethren : <EOV> <SOV> for whosoever shall do the will of God , * he * is my brother , and sister , and mother . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And again he began to teach by the sea . And a great crowd was gathered together to him , so that going on board ship he sat in the sea , and all the crowd were close to the sea on the land . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught them many things in parables . And he said to them in his doctrine , <EOV> <SOV> Hearken : Behold , the sower went forth to sow . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he sowed , one fell by the wayside , and the birds came and devoured it . <EOV> <SOV> And another fell on the rocky ground , where it had not much earth , and immediately it sprung up out [ of the ground ] because it had no depth of earth ; <EOV> <SOV> and when the sun arose it was burnt up , and because of its not having any root , it withered . <EOV> <SOV> And another fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked it , and it yielded no fruit . <EOV> <SOV> And another fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing ; and bore , one thirty , and one sixty , and one a hundred . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , He that has ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was alone , those about him with the twelve asked him [ as to ] the parables . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , To you is given [ to know ] the mystery of the kingdom of God ; but to them who are without , all things are done in parables , <EOV> <SOV> that beholding they may behold and not see , and hearing they may hear and not understand , lest it may be , they should be converted and they should be forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Do ye not know this parable ? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables ? <EOV> <SOV> The sower sows the word : <EOV> <SOV> and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown , and when they hear , immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them . <EOV> <SOV> And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places , who when they hear the word , immediately receive it with joy , <EOV> <SOV> and they have no root in themselves , but are for a time : then , tribulation arising , or persecution on account of the word , immediately they are offended . <EOV> <SOV> And others are they who are sown among the thorns : these are they who have heard the word , <EOV> <SOV> and the cares of life , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things , entering in , choke the word , and it becomes unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> And these are they who have been sown on the good ground , such as hear the word and receive it , and bear fruit ; one thirty , and one sixty , and one a hundred [ fold ] . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch ? [ Is it ] not that it should be set upon the lamp - stand ? <EOV> <SOV> For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest ; nor does any secret thing take place , but that it should come to light . <EOV> <SOV> If any one have ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take heed what ye hear ; with what measure ye mete , it shall be meted to you ; and there shall be [ more ] added to you . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever has , to him shall be given ; and he who has not , even what he has shall be taken from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Thus is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth , <EOV> <SOV> and should sleep and rise up night and day , and the seed should sprout and grow , he does not know how . <EOV> <SOV> The earth bears fruit of itself , first [ the ] blade , then an ear , then full corn in the ear . <EOV> <SOV> But when the fruit is produced , immediately he sends the sickle , for the harvest is come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , How should we liken the kingdom of God , or with what comparison should we compare it ? <EOV> <SOV> As to a grain of mustard [ seed ] , which , when it is sown upon the earth , is less than all seeds which are upon the earth , <EOV> <SOV> and when it has been sown , mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs , and produces great branches , so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow . <EOV> <SOV> And with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear , <EOV> <SOV> but without a parable spoke he not to them ; and in private he explained all things to his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And on that day , when evening was come , he says to them , Let us go over to the other side : <EOV> <SOV> and having sent away the crowd , they take him with [ them ] , as he was , in the ship . But other ships also were with him . <EOV> <SOV> And there comes a violent gust of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it already filled . <EOV> <SOV> And * he * was in the stern sleeping on the cushion . And they awake him up and say to him , Teacher , dost thou not care that we are perishing ? <EOV> <SOV> And awaking up he rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , Silence ; be mute . And the wind fell , and there was a great calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why are ye [ thus ] fearful ? how [ is it ] ye have not faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And they feared [ with ] great fear , and said one to another , Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And they came to the other side of the sea , to the country of the Gadarenes . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately on his going out of the ship there met him out of the tombs a man possessed by an unclean spirit , <EOV> <SOV> who had his dwelling in the tombs ; and no one was able to bind him , not even with chains ; <EOV> <SOV> because he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been torn asunder by him , and the fetters were shattered ; and no one was able to subdue him . <EOV> <SOV> And continually night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying and cutting himself with stones . <EOV> <SOV> But seeing Jesus from afar off , he ran and did him homage , <EOV> <SOV> and crying with a loud voice he says , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I adjure thee by God , torment me not . <EOV> <SOV> For he said to him , Come forth , unclean spirit , out of the man . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he says to him , Legion is my name , because we are many . <EOV> <SOV> And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding ; <EOV> <SOV> and they besought him , saying , Send us into the swine that we may enter into them . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus [ immediately ] allowed them . And the unclean spirits going out entered into the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep slope , into the sea ( about two thousand ) , and were choked in the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And those that were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that had taken place . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jesus , and they see the possessed of demons sitting [ and ] clothed and sensible , [ him ] that had had the legion : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And they that had seen [ it ] related to them how it had happened to the [ man ] possessed by demons , and concerning the swine . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to beg him to depart from their coasts . <EOV> <SOV> And as he went on board ship , the man that had been possessed by demons besought him that he might be with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he suffered him not , but says to him , Go to thine home to thine own people , and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee , and has had mercy on thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him ; and all wondered . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having passed over in the ship again to the other side , a great crowd gathered to him ; and he was by the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And [ behold ] there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue , by name Jairus , and seeing him , falls down at his feet ; <EOV> <SOV> and he besought him much , saying , My little daughter is at extremity ; [ I pray ] that thou shouldest come and lay thy hands upon her so that she may be healed , and may live . <EOV> <SOV> And he went with him , and a large crowd followed him and pressed on him . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain woman who had had a flux of blood twelve years , <EOV> <SOV> and had suffered much under many physicians , and had spent everything she had and had found no advantage from it , but had rather got worse , <EOV> <SOV> having heard concerning Jesus , came in the crowd behind and touched his clothes ; <EOV> <SOV> for she said , If I shall touch but his clothes I shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately her fountain of blood was dried up , and she knew in her body that she was cured from the scourge . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus , knowing in himself the power that had gone out of him , turning round in the crowd said , Who has touched my clothes ? <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples said to him , Thou seest the crowd pressing on thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ? <EOV> <SOV> And he looked round about to see her who had done this . <EOV> <SOV> But the woman , frightened and trembling , knowing what had taken place in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , Daughter , thy faith has healed thee ; go in peace , and be well of thy scourge . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking , they come from the ruler of the synagogue 's [ house ] , saying , Thy daughter has died , why troublest thou the teacher any further ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus [ immediately ] , having heard the word spoken , says to the ruler of the synagogue , Fear not ; only believe . <EOV> <SOV> And he suffered no one to accompany him save Peter and James , and John the brother of James . <EOV> <SOV> And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and sees the tumult , and people weeping and wailing greatly . <EOV> <SOV> And entering in he says to them , Why do ye make a tumult and weep ? the child has not died , but sleeps . <EOV> <SOV> And they derided him . But he , having put [ them ] all out , takes with [ him ] the father of the child , and the mother , and those that were with him , and enters in where the child was lying . <EOV> <SOV> And having laid hold of the hand of the child , he says to her , Talitha koumi , which is , interpreted , Damsel , I say to thee , Arise . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the damsel arose and walked , for she was twelve years old . And they were astonished with great astonishment . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them much that no one should know this ; and he desired that [ something ] should be given her to eat . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he went out thence and came to his own country , and his disciples follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And when sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue , and many hearing were amazed , saying , Whence [ has ] this [ man ] these things ? and what [ is ] the wisdom that is given to him , and such works of power are done by his hands ? <EOV> <SOV> Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , and Joses , and Judas , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended in him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not despised save in his own country , and among [ his ] kinsmen , and in his own house . <EOV> <SOV> And he could not do any work of power there , save that laying his hands on a few infirm persons he healed [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> And he wondered because of their unbelief . And he went round the villages in a circuit , teaching . <EOV> <SOV> And he calls the twelve to [ him ] ; and he began to send them out two [ and ] two , and gave to them power over the unclean spirits ; <EOV> <SOV> and he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their belt ; <EOV> <SOV> but be shod with sandals , and put not on two body - coats . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Wheresoever ye shall enter into a house , there remain till ye shall go thence . <EOV> <SOV> And whatsoever place shall not receive you nor hear you , departing thence , shake off the dust which is under your feet for a testimony to them . <EOV> <SOV> And they went forth and preached that they should repent ; <EOV> <SOV> and they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many infirm , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod the king heard [ of him ] ( for his name had become public ) , and said , John the baptist is risen from among [ the ] dead , and on this account works of power are wrought by him . <EOV> <SOV> And others said , It is Elias ; and others said , It is a prophet , as one of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But Herod when he heard [ it ] said , John whom * I * beheaded , he it is ; * he * is risen [ from among the dead ] . <EOV> <SOV> For the same Herod had sent and seized John , and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias , the wife of Philip his brother , because he had married her . <EOV> <SOV> For John said to Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have the wife of thy brother . <EOV> <SOV> But Herodias kept it [ in her mind ] against him , and wished to kill him , and could not : <EOV> <SOV> for Herod feared John knowing that he was a just and holy man , and kept him safe ; and having heard him , did many things , and heard him gladly . <EOV> <SOV> And a holiday being come , when Herod , on his birthday , made a supper to his grandees , and to the chiliarchs , and the chief [ men ] of Galilee ; <EOV> <SOV> and the daughter of the same Herodias having come in , and danced , pleased Herod and those that were with [ him ] at table ; and the king said to the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he swore to her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask me I will give thee , to half of my kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And she went out , and said to her mother , What should I ask ? And she said , The head of John the baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately going in with haste to the king , she asked saying , I desire that thou give me directly upon a dish the head of John the baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And the king , [ while ] made very sorry , on account of the oaths and those lying at table with [ him ] would not break his word with her . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the king , having sent one of the guard , ordered his head to be brought . And he went out and beheaded him in the prison , <EOV> <SOV> and brought his head upon a dish , and gave it to the damsel , and the damsel gave it to her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples having heard [ it ] , came and took up his body , and laid it in a tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles are gathered together to Jesus . And they related to him all things , [ both ] what they had done and what they had taught . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little . For those coming and those going were many , and they had not leisure even to eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they went away apart into a desert place by ship . <EOV> <SOV> And many saw them going , and recognised them , and ran together there on foot , out of all the cities , and got [ there ] before them . <EOV> <SOV> And on leaving [ the ship ] [ Jesus ] saw a great crowd , and he was moved with compassion for them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd . And he began to teach them many things . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was already late in the day , his disciples coming to him say , The place is desert , and it is already late in the day ; <EOV> <SOV> send them away that they may go into the country and villages around , and buy themselves bread , for they have not anything they can eat . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , Give * ye * them to eat . And they say to him , Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , How many loaves have ye ? Go [ and ] see . And when they knew they say , Five , and two fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he ordered them to make them all sit down by companies on the green grass . <EOV> <SOV> And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , looking up to heaven , he blessed , and broke the loaves , and gave [ them ] to his disciples that they might set [ them ] before them . And the two fishes he divided among all . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate and were satisfied . <EOV> <SOV> And they took up of fragments the fillings of twelve hand - baskets , and of the fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And those that ate of the loaves were five thousand men . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he compelled his disciples to go on board ship , and to go on before to the other side to Bethsaida , while * he * sends the crowd away . <EOV> <SOV> And , having dismissed them , he departed into the mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And when evening was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and * he * alone upon the land . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing them labouring in rowing , for the wind was contrary to them , about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking on the sea , and would have passed them by . <EOV> <SOV> But they , seeing him walking on the sea , thought that it was an apparition , and cried out . <EOV> <SOV> For all saw him and were troubled . And immediately he spoke with them , and says to them , Be of good courage : it is * I * ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And he went up to them into the ship , and the wind fell . And they were exceedingly beyond measure astonished in themselves and wondered ; <EOV> <SOV> for they understood not through the loaves : for their heart was hardened . <EOV> <SOV> And having passed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret and made the shore . <EOV> <SOV> And on their coming out of the ship , immediately recognising him , <EOV> <SOV> they ran through that whole country around , and began to carry about those that were ill on couches , where they heard that he was . <EOV> <SOV> And wherever he entered into villages , or cities , or the country , they laid the sick in the market - places , and besought him that they might touch if it were only the hem of his garment ; and as many as touched him were healed . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the Pharisees and some of the scribes , coming from Jerusalem , are gathered together to him , <EOV> <SOV> and seeing some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is , unwashed , hands , <EOV> <SOV> ( for the Pharisees and all the Jews , unless they wash their hands diligently , do not eat , holding what has been delivered by the ancients ; <EOV> <SOV> and [ on coming ] from the market - place , unless they are washed , they do not eat ; and there are many other things which they have received to hold , the washing of cups and vessels , and brazen utensils , and couches ) , <EOV> <SOV> then the Pharisees and the scribes ask him , Why do thy disciples not walk according to what has been delivered by the ancients , but eat the bread with defiled hands ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to them , Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honour me with their lips , but their heart is far away from me . <EOV> <SOV> But in vain do they worship me , teaching [ as their ] teachings commandments of men . <EOV> <SOV> [ For ] , leaving the commandment of God , ye hold what is delivered by men [ to keep ] -- washings of vessels and cups , and many other such like things ye do . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Well do ye set aside the commandment of God , that ye may observe what is delivered by yourselves [ to keep ] . <EOV> <SOV> For Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , he who speaks ill of father or mother , let him surely die . <EOV> <SOV> But * ye * say , If a man say to his father or his mother , [ It is ] corban ( that is , gift ) , whatsoever thou mightest have profit from me by ... <EOV> <SOV> And ye no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother ; <EOV> <SOV> making void the word of God by your traditional teaching which ye have delivered ; and many such like things ye do . <EOV> <SOV> And having called again the crowd , he said to them , Hear me , all [ of you ] , and understand : <EOV> <SOV> There is nothing from outside a man entering into him which can defile him ; but the things which go out from him , those it is which defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> If any one have ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And when he went indoors from the crowd , his disciples asked him concerning the parable . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Are * ye * also thus unintelligent ? Do ye not perceive that all that is outside entering into the man can not defile him , <EOV> <SOV> because it does not enter into his heart but into his belly , and goes out into the draught , purging all meats ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , That which goes forth out of the man , that defiles the man . <EOV> <SOV> For from within , out of the heart of men , go forth evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders , <EOV> <SOV> thefts , covetousness , wickednesses , deceit , licentiousness , a wicked eye , injurious language , haughtiness , folly ; <EOV> <SOV> all these wicked things go forth from within and defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> And he rose up and went away thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon ; and having entered into a house he would not have any one know [ it ] , and he could not be hid . <EOV> <SOV> But immediately a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell at his feet <EOV> <SOV> ( and the woman was a Greek , Syrophenician by race ) , and asked him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter . <EOV> <SOV> But [ Jesus ] said to her , Suffer the children to be first filled ; for it is not right to take the children 's bread and cast it to the dogs . <EOV> <SOV> But she answered and says to him , Yea , Lord ; for even the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crumbs . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , Because of this word , go thy way , the demon is gone out of thy daughter . <EOV> <SOV> And having gone away to her house she found the demon gone out , and her daughter lying on the bed . <EOV> <SOV> And again having left the borders of Tyre and Sidon , he came to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis . <EOV> <SOV> And they bring to him a deaf [ man ] who could not speak right , and they beseech him that he might lay his hand on him . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken him away from the crowd apart , he put his fingers to his ears ; and having spit , he touched his tongue ; <EOV> <SOV> and looking up to heaven he groaned , and says to him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately his ears were opened , and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them that they should speak to no one [ of it ] . But so much the more * he * charged them , so much the more abundantly * they * proclaimed it ; <EOV> <SOV> and they were astonished above measure , saying , He does all things well ; he makes both the deaf to hear , and the speechless to speak . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In those days , there being again a great crowd , and they having nothing that they could eat , having called his disciples to [ him ] , he says to them , <EOV> <SOV> I have compassion on the crowd , because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat , <EOV> <SOV> and if I should dismiss them to their home fasting , they will faint on the way ; for some of them are come from far . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples answered him , Whence shall one be able to satisfy these with bread here in a desert place ? <EOV> <SOV> And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground . And having taken the seven loaves , he gave thanks , and broke [ them ] and gave [ them ] to his disciples , that they might set [ them ] before [ them ] ; and they set [ them ] before the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> And they had a few small fishes , and having blessed them , he desired these also to be set before [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> And they ate and were satisfied . And they took up of fragments that remained seven baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And they [ that had eaten ] were about four thousand ; and he sent them away . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately going on board ship with his disciples , he came into the parts of Dalmanutha . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees went out and began to dispute against him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , tempting him . <EOV> <SOV> And groaning in his spirit , he says , Why does this generation seek a sign ? Verily I say unto you , A sign shall in no wise be given to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And he left them , and going again on board ship , went away to the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And they forgot to take bread , and save one loaf , they had not [ any ] with them in the ship . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [ of ] the leaven of Herod . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with one another , [ saying ] , It is because we have no bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus knowing [ it ] , says to them , Why reason ye because ye have no bread ? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand ? Have ye your heart [ yet ] hardened ? <EOV> <SOV> Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ? <EOV> <SOV> When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many hand - baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say to him , Twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And when the seven for the four thousand , the filling of how many baskets of fragments took ye up ? And they said , Seven . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , How do ye not yet understand ? <EOV> <SOV> And he comes to Bethsaida ; and they bring him a blind man , and beseech him that he might touch him . <EOV> <SOV> And taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village , and having spit upon his eyes , he laid his hands upon him , and asked him if he beheld anything . <EOV> <SOV> And having looked up , he said , I behold men , for I see [ them ] , as trees , walking . <EOV> <SOV> Then he laid his hands again upon his eyes , and he saw distinctly , and was restored and saw all things clearly . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent him to his house , saying , Neither enter into the village , nor tell [ it ] to any one in the village . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went forth and his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea - Philippi . And by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Who do men say that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And they answered him , saying , John the baptist ; and others , Elias ; but others , One of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked them , But * ye * , who do ye say that I am ? And Peter answering says to him , * Thou * art the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them straitly , in order that they should tell no man about him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and of the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise [ again ] . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke the thing openly . And Peter , taking him to [ him ] , began to rebuke him . <EOV> <SOV> But he , turning round and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , saying , Get away behind me , Satan , for thy mind is not on the things that are of God , but on the things that are of men . <EOV> <SOV> And having called the crowd with his disciples , he said to them , Whoever desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it , but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's shall save it . <EOV> <SOV> For what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul ? <EOV> <SOV> for what should a man give in exchange for his soul ? <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him shall the Son of man also be ashamed when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said to them , Verily I say unto you , There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power . <EOV> <SOV> And after six days Jesus takes with [ him ] Peter and James and John , and takes them up on a high mountain by themselves apart . And he was transfigured before them : <EOV> <SOV> and his garments became shining , exceeding white [ as snow ] , such as fuller on earth could not whiten [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared to them Elias with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering says to Jesus , Rabbi , it is good that we should be here ; and let us make three tabernacles , for thee one , and for Moses one , and for Elias one . <EOV> <SOV> For he knew not what he should say , for they were filled with fear . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a cloud overshadowing them , and there came a voice out of the cloud , * This * is my beloved Son : hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly having looked around , they no longer saw any one , but Jesus alone with themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And as they descended from the mountain , he charged them that they should relate to no one what they had seen , unless when the Son of man should be risen from among [ the ] dead . <EOV> <SOV> And they kept that saying , questioning among themselves , what rising from among [ the ] dead was . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him saying , Why do the scribes say that Elias must first have come ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , Elias indeed , having first come , restores all things ; and how is it written of the Son of man that he must suffer much , and be set at nought : <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you that Elias also is come , and they have done to him whatever they would , as it is written of him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to the disciples he saw a great crowd around them , and scribes disputing against them . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately all the crowd seeing him were amazed , and running to [ him ] , saluted him . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked them , What do ye question with them about ? <EOV> <SOV> And one out of the crowd answered him , Teacher , I brought to thee my son , who has a dumb spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> and wheresoever it seizes him it tears him , and he foams and gnashes his teeth , and he is withering away . And I spoke to thy disciples , that they might cast him out , and they could not . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering them says , O unbelieving generation ! how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? bring him to me . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought him to him . And seeing him the spirit immediately tore him ; and falling upon the earth he rolled foaming . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked his father , How long a time is it that it has been like this with him ? And he said , From childhood ; <EOV> <SOV> and often it has cast him both into fire and into waters that it might destroy him : but if thou couldst [ do ] anything , be moved with pity on us , and help us . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , The ' if thou couldst ' is [ if thou couldst ] believe : all things are possible to him that believes . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the father of the young child crying out said [ with tears ] , I believe , help mine unbelief . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , seeing that [ the ] crowd was running up together , rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , * I * command thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him . <EOV> <SOV> And having cried out and torn [ him ] much , he came out ; and he became as if dead , so that the most said , He is dead . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , having taken hold of him by the hand , lifted him up , and he arose . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was entered into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Wherefore could not * we * cast him out ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , This kind can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting . <EOV> <SOV> And going forth from thence they went through Galilee ; and he would not that any one knew it ; <EOV> <SOV> for he taught his disciples and said to them , The Son of man is delivered into men 's hands , and they shall kill him ; and having been killed , after three days he shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> But they understood not the saying , and feared to ask him . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Capernaum , and being in the house , he asked them , Of what were ye reasoning by the way ? <EOV> <SOV> And they remained silent , for by the way they had been reasoning with one another who [ was ] greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And sitting down he called the twelve ; and he says to them , If any one would be first , he shall be last of all , and minister of all . <EOV> <SOV> And taking a little child he set it in their midst , and having taken it in his arms he said to them , <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name , receives me ; and whosoever shall receive me , does not receive me , but him who sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And John answered him saying , Teacher , we saw some one casting out demons in thy name , who does not follow us , and we forbad him , because he does not follow us . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Forbid him not ; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name , and be able soon [ after ] to speak ill of me ; <EOV> <SOV> for he who is not against us is for us . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in [ my ] name , because ye are Christ 's , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall be a snare to one of the little ones who believe [ in me ] , it were better for him if a millstone were hung about his neck , and he cast into the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy hand serve as a snare to thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having thy two hands to go away into hell , into the fire unquenchable ; <EOV> <SOV> [ where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched ] . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy foot serve as a snare to thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life lame , than having thy two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire unquenchable ; <EOV> <SOV> [ where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched ] . <EOV> <SOV> And if thine eye serve as a snare to thee , cast it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire , <EOV> <SOV> where their worm dies not , and the fire is not quenched . <EOV> <SOV> For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt . <EOV> <SOV> Salt [ is ] good , but if the salt is become saltless , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And rising up thence he comes into the coasts of Judaea , and the other side of the Jordan . And again crowds come together to him , and , as he was accustomed , again he taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And Pharisees coming to [ him ] asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away [ his ] wife ? ( tempting him ) . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to them , What did Moses command you ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce , and to put away . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , In view of your hard - heartedness he wrote this commandment for you ; <EOV> <SOV> but from [ the ] beginning of [ the ] creation God made them male and female . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be united to his wife , <EOV> <SOV> and the two shall be one flesh : so that they are no longer two but one flesh . <EOV> <SOV> What therefore God has joined together , let not man separate . <EOV> <SOV> And again in the house the disciples asked him concerning this . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Whosoever shall put away his wife and shall marry another , commits adultery against her . <EOV> <SOV> And if a woman put away her husband and shall marry another , she commits adultery . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought little children to him that he might touch them . But the disciples rebuked those that brought [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus seeing [ it ] , was indignant , and said to them , Suffer the little children to come to me ; forbid them not ; for of such is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , shall in no wise enter into it . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken them in his arms , having laid his hands on them , he blessed them . <EOV> <SOV> And as he went forth into the way , a person ran up to [ him ] , and kneeling to him asked him , Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ? no one is good but one , [ that is ] God . <EOV> <SOV> Thou knowest the commandments : Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honour thy father and mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to him , Teacher , all these things have I kept from my youth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus looking upon him loved him , and said to him , One thing lackest thou : go , sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me , [ taking up the cross ] . <EOV> <SOV> But he , sad at the word , went away grieved , for he had large possessions . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus looking around says to his disciples , How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples were amazed at his words . And Jesus again answering says to them , Children , how difficult it is that those who trust in riches should enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they were exceedingly astonished , saying to one another , And who can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus looking on them says , With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God . <EOV> <SOV> Peter began to say to him , Behold , * we * have left all things and have followed thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answering said , Verily I say to you , There is no one who has left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , [ or wife ] , or children , or lands , for my sake and for the sake of the gospel , <EOV> <SOV> that shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time : houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions , and in the coming age life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> But many first shall be last , and the last first . <EOV> <SOV> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going on before them ; and they were amazed , and were afraid as they followed . And taking the twelve again to [ him ] , he began to tell them what was going to happen to him : <EOV> <SOV> Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him up to the nations : <EOV> <SOV> and they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him ; and after three days he shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And there come to him James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying [ to him ] , Teacher , we would that whatsoever we may ask thee , thou wouldst do it for us . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What would ye that I should do for you ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Give to us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and one on thy left hand , in thy glory . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Ye do not know what ye ask . Are ye able to drink the cup which * I * drink , or be baptised with the baptism that * I * am baptised with ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , We are able . And Jesus said to them , The cup that * I * drink ye will drink and with the baptism that * I * am baptised with ye will be baptised , <EOV> <SOV> but to sit on my right hand or on my left is not mine to give , but for those for whom it is prepared . <EOV> <SOV> And the ten having heard [ of it ] , began to be indignant about James and John . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus having called them to [ him ] , says to them , Ye know that those who are esteemed to rule over the nations exercise lordship over them ; and their great men exercise authority over them ; <EOV> <SOV> but it is not thus among you ; but whosoever would be great among you , shall be your minister ; <EOV> <SOV> and whosoever would be first of you shall be bondman of all . <EOV> <SOV> For also the Son of man did not come to be ministered to , but to minister , and give his life a ransom for many . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jericho , and as he was going out from Jericho , and his disciples and a large crowd , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , the blind [ man ] , sat by the wayside begging . <EOV> <SOV> And having heard that it was Jesus the Nazaraean , he began to cry out and to say , O Son of David , Jesus , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And many rebuked him , that he might be silent ; but he cried so much the more , Son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , standing still , desired him to be called . And they call the blind [ man ] , saying to him , Be of good courage , rise up , he calls thee . <EOV> <SOV> And , throwing away his garment , he started up and came to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering says to him , What wilt thou that I shall do to thee ? And the blind [ man ] said to him , Rabboni , that I may see . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Go , thy faith has healed thee . And he saw immediately , and followed him in the way . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they draw near to Jerusalem , to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sends two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and says to them , Go into the village which is over against you , and immediately on entering into it ye will find a colt tied , upon which no [ child ] of man has ever sat : loose it and lead it [ here ] . <EOV> <SOV> And if any one say to you , Why do ye this ? say , The Lord has need of it ; and straightway he sends it hither . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed , and found a colt bound to the door without at the crossway , and they loose him . <EOV> <SOV> And some of those who stood there said to them , What are ye doing , loosing the colt ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said to them as Jesus had commanded . And they let them [ do it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And they led the colt to Jesus , and cast their clothes upon it , and he sat on it ; <EOV> <SOV> and many strewed their clothes on the way , and others cut down branches from the trees [ and went on strewing them on the way ] . <EOV> <SOV> And those going on before and those following cried out , Hosanna ! blessed [ be ] he that comes in [ the ] Lord 's name . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed [ be ] the coming kingdom of our father David . Hosanna in the highest ! <EOV> <SOV> And he entered into Jerusalem and into the temple ; and having looked round on all things , the hour being already late , he went out to Bethany with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow , when they were gone out of Bethany , he hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing from afar off a fig - tree which had leaves , he came , if perhaps he might find something on it . And having come up to it he found nothing but leaves , for it was not the time of figs . <EOV> <SOV> And answering he said to it , Let no one eat fruit of thee any more for ever . And his disciples heard [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jerusalem , and entering into the temple , he began to cast out those who sold and who bought in the temple , and he overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the dove - sellers , <EOV> <SOV> and suffered not that any one should carry any package through the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught saying to them , Is it not written , My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? but * ye * have made it a den of robbers . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes heard [ it ] , and they sought how they might destroy him ; for they feared him , because all the crowd were astonished at his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was evening he went forth without the city . <EOV> <SOV> And passing by early in the morning they saw the fig - tree dried up from the roots . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter , remembering [ what Jesus had said ] , says to him , Rabbi , see , the fig - tree which thou cursedst is dried up . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering says to them , Have faith in God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , that whosoever shall say to this mountain , Be thou taken away and cast into the sea , and shall not doubt in his heart , but believe that what he says takes place , whatever he shall say shall come to pass for him . <EOV> <SOV> For this reason I say to you , All things whatsoever ye pray for and ask , believe that ye receive it , and it shall come to pass for you . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye stand praying , forgive if ye have anything against any one , that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your offences . <EOV> <SOV> But if * ye * do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your offences . <EOV> <SOV> And they come again to Jerusalem . And as he walked about in the temple , the chief priests and the scribes and the elders come to him , <EOV> <SOV> and they say to him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority , that thou shouldest do these things ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , * I * also will ask you one thing , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things : <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it of heaven , or of men ? answer me . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we should say , Of heaven , he will say , Why [ then ] have ye not believed him ? <EOV> <SOV> but should we say , Of men -- they feared the people ; for all held of John that he was truly a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answering say to Jesus , We do not know . And Jesus [ answering ] says to them , Neither do * I * tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he began to say to them in parables , A man planted a vineyard , and made a fence round [ it ] and dug a wine - vat , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and left the country . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent a bondman to the husbandmen at the season , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> But they took him , and beat [ him ] , and sent [ him ] away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent to them another bondman ; and [ at ] him they [ threw stones , and ] struck [ him ] on the head , and sent [ him ] away with insult . <EOV> <SOV> And [ again ] he sent another , and him they killed ; and many others , beating some and killing some . <EOV> <SOV> Having yet therefore one beloved son , he sent also him to them the last , saying , They will have respect for my son . <EOV> <SOV> But those husbandmen said to one another , This is the heir : come , let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours . <EOV> <SOV> And they took him and killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do ? He will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . <EOV> <SOV> Have ye not even read this scripture , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner - stone : <EOV> <SOV> this is of [ the ] Lord , and it is wonderful in our eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> And they sought to lay hold of him , and they feared the crowd ; for they knew that he had spoken the parable of them . And they left him and went away . <EOV> <SOV> And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , that they might catch him in speaking . <EOV> <SOV> And they come and say to him , Teacher , we know that thou art true , and carest not for any one ; for thou regardest not men 's person , but teachest the way of God with truth : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not ? <EOV> <SOV> Should we give , or should we not give ? But he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? Bring me a denarius that I may see [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought [ it ] . And he says to them , Whose [ is ] this image and superscription ? And they said to him , Caesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Pay what is Caesar 's to Caesar , and what is God 's to God . And they wondered at him . <EOV> <SOV> And Sadducees come to him , that say there is no resurrection ; and they demanded of him saying , <EOV> <SOV> Teacher , Moses wrote to us that if any one 's brother die , and leave a wife behind , and leave no children , that his brother shall take his wife , and raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> There were seven brethren ; and the first took a wife , and dying did not leave seed ; <EOV> <SOV> and the second took her and died , and neither did he leave seed ; and the third likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And the seven [ took her and ] did not leave seed . Last of all the woman also died . <EOV> <SOV> In the resurrection , when they shall rise again , of which of them shall she be wife , for the seven had her as wife ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Do not ye therefore err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God ? <EOV> <SOV> For when they rise from among [ the ] dead they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as angels [ who are ] in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> But concerning the dead that they rise , have ye not read in the book of Moses , in [ the section of ] the bush , how God spoke to him , saying , * I * [ am ] the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not the God of [ the ] dead , but of [ the ] living . * Ye * therefore greatly err . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the scribes who had come up , and had heard them reasoning together , perceiving that he had answered them well , demanded of him , Which is [ the ] first commandment of all ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered him , [ The ] first commandment of all [ is ] , Hear , Israel : the Lord our God is one Lord ; <EOV> <SOV> and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thine understanding , and with all thy strength . This is [ the ] first commandment . <EOV> <SOV> And a second like it [ is ] this : Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . There is not another commandment greater than these . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribe said to him , Right , teacher ; thou hast spoken according to [ the ] truth . For he is one , and there is none other besides him ; <EOV> <SOV> and to love him with all the heart , and with all the intelligence , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love one 's neighbour as one 's self , is more than all the burnt - offerings and sacrifices . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , seeing that he had answered intelligently , said to him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no one dared question him any more . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said [ as he was ] teaching in the temple , How do the scribes say that the Christ is son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> [ for ] David himself said [ speaking ] in the Holy Spirit , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies [ as ] footstool of thy feet . <EOV> <SOV> David himself [ therefore ] calls him Lord , and whence is he his son ? And the mass of the people heard him gladly . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes , and salutations in the marketplaces , <EOV> <SOV> and first seats in the synagogues , and first places at suppers ; <EOV> <SOV> who devour the houses of widows , and as a pretext make long prayers . These shall receive a severer judgment . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having sat down opposite the treasury , saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury ; and many rich cast in much . <EOV> <SOV> And a poor widow came and cast in two mites , which is a farthing . <EOV> <SOV> And having called his disciples to [ him ] he said to them , Verily I say unto you , This poor widow has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury : <EOV> <SOV> for all have cast in of that which they had in abundance , but she of her destitution has cast in all that she had , the whole of her living . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as he was going out of the temple , one of his disciples says to him , Teacher , see what stones and what buildings ! <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him , Seest thou these great buildings ? not a stone shall be left upon a stone , which shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately , <EOV> <SOV> Tell us , when shall these things be , and what is the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering them began to say , Take heed lest any one mislead you . <EOV> <SOV> For many shall come in my name , saying , It is * I * , and shall mislead many . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be not disturbed , for [ this ] must happen , but the end is not yet . <EOV> <SOV> For nation shall rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be earthquakes in [ different ] places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these things [ are the ] beginnings of throes . <EOV> <SOV> But * ye * , take heed to yourselves , for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims and to synagogues : ye shall be beaten and brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them ; <EOV> <SOV> and the gospel must first be preached to all the nations . <EOV> <SOV> But when they shall lead you away to deliver you up , be not careful beforehand as to what ye shall say , [ nor prepare your discourse ] : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ; for * ye * are not the speakers , but the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> But brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child ; and children shall rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will be hated of all on account of my name ; but he that has endured to the end , * he * shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not , ( he that reads let him consider [ it ] , ) then let those in Judaea flee to the mountains ; <EOV> <SOV> and him that is upon the housetop not come down into the house , nor enter [ into it ] to take away anything out of his house ; <EOV> <SOV> and him that is in the field not return back to take his garment . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days ! <EOV> <SOV> And pray that it may not be in winter time ; <EOV> <SOV> for those days shall be distress such as there has not been the like since [ the ] beginning of creation which God created , until now , and never shall be ; <EOV> <SOV> and if [ the ] Lord had not cut short those days , no flesh should have been saved ; but on account of the elect whom he has chosen , he has cut short those days . <EOV> <SOV> And then if any one say to you , Lo , here [ is ] the Christ , or Lo , there , believe [ it ] not . <EOV> <SOV> For false Christs and false prophets will arise , and give signs and wonders to deceive , if possible , even the elect . <EOV> <SOV> But do * ye * take heed : behold , I have told you all things beforehand . <EOV> <SOV> But in those days , after that distress , the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give its light ; <EOV> <SOV> and the stars of heaven shall be falling down , and the powers which are in the heavens shall be shaken ; <EOV> <SOV> and then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory ; <EOV> <SOV> and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from end of earth to end of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But learn the parable from the fig - tree : when its branch already becomes tender and puts forth the leaves , ye know that the summer is near . <EOV> <SOV> Thus also * ye * , when ye see these things happening , know that it is near , at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , This generation shall in no wise pass away , till all these things take place . <EOV> <SOV> The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall in no wise pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But of that day or of that hour no one knows , neither the angels who are in heaven , nor the Son , but the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed , watch and pray , for ye do not know when the time is : <EOV> <SOV> [ it is ] as a man gone out of the country , having left his house and given to his bondmen the authority , and to each one his work , and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore , for ye do not know when the master of the house comes : evening , or midnight , or cock - crow , or morning ; <EOV> <SOV> lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping . <EOV> <SOV> But what I say to you , I say to all , Watch . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now the passover and the [ feast of ] unleavened bread was after two days . And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might seize him by subtlety and kill him . <EOV> <SOV> For they said , Not in the feast , lest perhaps there be a tumult of the people . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , as he lay at table , there came a woman having an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard , very costly ; and having broken the alabaster flask , she poured it out upon his head . <EOV> <SOV> And there were some indignant in themselves , and saying , Why has this waste been made of the ointment ? <EOV> <SOV> for this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor . And they spoke very angrily at her . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Let her alone ; why do ye trouble her ? she has wrought a good work as to me ; <EOV> <SOV> for ye have the poor always with you , and whenever ye would ye can do them good ; but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> What * she * could she has done . She has beforehand anointed my body for the burial . <EOV> <SOV> And verily I say unto you , Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world , what this [ woman ] has done shall be also spoken of for a memorial of her . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas Iscariote , one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them ; <EOV> <SOV> and they , when they heard it , rejoiced , and promised him to give money . And he sought how he could opportunely deliver him up . <EOV> <SOV> And the first day of unleavened bread , when they slew the passover , his disciples say to him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare , that thou mayest eat the passover ? <EOV> <SOV> And he sends two of his disciples , and says to them , Go into the city , and a man shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water ; follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And wheresoever he enters , say to the master of the house , The Teacher says , Where is my guest - chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> and * he * will shew you a large upper room furnished ready . There make ready for us . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples went away and came into the city , and found as he had said to them ; and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when evening was come , he comes with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And as they lay at table and were eating , Jesus said , Verily I say to you , One of you shall deliver me up ; he who is eating with me . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to be grieved , and to say to him , one by one , Is it * I * ? [ and another , Is it * I * ? ] <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said to them , One of the twelve , he who dips with me in the dish . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man goes indeed as it is written concerning him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up ; [ it were ] good for that man if he had not been born . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating , Jesus , having taken bread , when he had blessed , broke [ it ] , and gave [ it ] to them , and said , Take [ this ] : this is my body . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken [ the ] cup , when he had given thanks , he gave [ it ] to them , and they all drank out of it . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , This is my blood , that of the [ new ] covenant , that shed for many . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , I will no more drink at all of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And having sung a hymn , they went out to the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus says to them , All ye shall be offended , for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> But after I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter said to him , Even if all should be offended , yet not * I*. <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus says to him , Verily I say to thee , that thou to - day , in this night , before [ the ] cock shall crow twice , thou shalt thrice deny me . <EOV> <SOV> But he said [ so much ] exceedingly the more , If I should have to die with thee , I will in no wise deny thee . And likewise said they all too . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to a place of which the name [ is ] Gethsemane , and he says to his disciples , Sit here while I shall pray . <EOV> <SOV> And he takes with him Peter and James and John , and he began to be amazed and oppressed in spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , My soul is full of grief even unto death ; abide here and watch . <EOV> <SOV> And , going forward a little , he fell upon the earth ; and he prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible to thee : take away this cup from me ; but not what * I * will , but what * thou * [ wilt ] . <EOV> <SOV> And he comes and finds them sleeping . And he says to Peter , Simon , dost thou sleep ? Hast thou not been able to watch one hour ? <EOV> <SOV> Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation . The spirit indeed [ is ] willing , but the flesh weak . <EOV> <SOV> And going away , he prayed again , saying the same thing . <EOV> <SOV> And returning , he found them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy ; and they knew not what they should answer him . <EOV> <SOV> And he comes the third time and says to them , Sleep on now , and take your rest . It is enough ; the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Arise , let us go ; behold , he that delivers me up has drawn nigh . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately , while he was yet speaking , Judas comes up , [ being ] one of the twelve , and with him a great crowd , with swords and sticks , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders . <EOV> <SOV> Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign between them , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he ; seize him , and lead [ him ] away safely . <EOV> <SOV> And being come , straightway coming up to him , he says , Rabbi , Rabbi ; and he covered him with kisses . <EOV> <SOV> And they laid their hands upon him and seized him . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain one of those who stood by , having drawn his sword , struck the bondman of the high priest , and took off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Are ye come out as against a robber , with swords and sticks to take me ? <EOV> <SOV> I was daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye did not seize me ; but [ it is ] that the scriptures may be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And all left him and fled . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain young man followed him with a linen cloth cast about his naked [ body ] ; and [ the young men ] seize him ; <EOV> <SOV> but he , leaving the linen cloth behind [ him ] , fled from them naked . <EOV> <SOV> And they led away Jesus to the high priest . And there come together to him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter followed him at a distance , till [ he was ] within the court of the high priest 's palace ; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light [ of the fire ] . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the whole sanhedrim sought testimony against Jesus to cause him to be put to death , and did not find [ any ] . <EOV> <SOV> For many bore false witness against him , and their testimony did not agree . <EOV> <SOV> And certain persons rose up and bore false witness against him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> * We * heard him saying , * I * will destroy this temple which is made with hands , and in the course of three days I will build another not made with hands . <EOV> <SOV> And neither thus did their testimony agree . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest , rising up before them all , asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? What do these testify against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> But he was silent , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and says to him , * Thou * art the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , * I * am , and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power , and coming with the clouds of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest , having rent his clothes , says , What need have we any more of witnesses ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard the blasphemy ; what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death . <EOV> <SOV> And some began to spit upon him , and cover up his face , and buffet him , and say to him , Prophesy ; and the officers struck him with the palms of their hands . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter being below in the palace - court , there comes one of the maids of the high priest , <EOV> <SOV> and seeing Peter warming himself , having looked at him , says , And * thou * wast with the Nazarene , Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied , saying , I know not nor understand what thou sayest . And he went out into the vestibule ; and a cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And the maid , seeing him , again began to say to those that stood by , This is [ one ] of them . <EOV> <SOV> And he again denied . And again , after a little , those that stood by said to Peter , Truly thou art [ one ] of them , for also thou art a Galilean . <EOV> <SOV> But he began to curse and to swear , I know not this man of whom ye speak . <EOV> <SOV> And the second time a cock crew . And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him , Before [ the ] cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice ; and when he thought thereon he wept . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And immediately in the morning the chief priests , having taken counsel with the elders and scribes and the whole sanhedrim , bound Jesus and carried [ him ] away , and delivered [ him ] up to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him , Art * thou * the King of the Jews ? And he answered and said to him , * Thou * sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests accused him urgently . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? See of how many things they bear witness against thee . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus still answered nothing , so that Pilate marvelled . <EOV> <SOV> But at [ the ] feast he released to them one prisoner , whomsoever they begged [ of him ] . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was the [ person ] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [ him ] , [ and ] that had committed murder in the insurrection . <EOV> <SOV> And the crowd crying out began to beg [ that he would do ] to them as he had always done . <EOV> <SOV> But Pilate answered them saying , Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that he might rather release Barabbas to them . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate answering said to them again , What will ye then that I do [ to him ] whom ye call King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> And they cried out again , Crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said to them , What evil then has he done ? But they cried out the more urgently , Crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate , desirous of contenting the crowd , released to them Barabbas , and delivered up Jesus , when he had scourged him , that he might be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers led him away into the court which is [ called the ] praetorium , and they call together the whole band . <EOV> <SOV> And they clothe him with purple , and bind round on him a crown of thorns which they had plaited . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews ! <EOV> <SOV> And they struck his head with a reed , and spat on him , and , bending the knee , did him homage . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had mocked him , they took the purple off him , and put his own clothes on him ; and they lead him out that they may crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And they compel to go [ with them ] a certain passer - by , Simon , a Cyrenian , coming from the field , the father of Alexander and Rufus , that he might carry his cross . <EOV> <SOV> And they bring him to the place [ called ] Golgotha , which , being interpreted , is Place of a skull . <EOV> <SOV> And they offered him wine [ to drink ] medicated with myrrh ; but he did not take [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And having crucified him , they part his clothes amongst [ themselves ] , casting lots on them , what each one should take . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the third hour , and they crucified him . <EOV> <SOV> And the superscription of what he was accused of was written up : The King of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> And with him they crucify two robbers , one on his right hand , and one on his left . <EOV> <SOV> [ And the scripture was fulfilled which says , And he was reckoned with the lawless . ] <EOV> <SOV> And they that passed by reviled him , shaking their heads , and saying , Aha , thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days , <EOV> <SOV> save thyself , and descend from the cross . <EOV> <SOV> In like manner the chief priests also , with the scribes , mocking with one another , said , He saved others ; himself he can not save . <EOV> <SOV> Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and may believe . And they that were crucified with him reproached him . <EOV> <SOV> And when [ the ] sixth hour was come , there came darkness over the whole land until [ the ] ninth hour ; <EOV> <SOV> and at the ninth hour , Jesus cried with a loud voice , [ saying ] , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? <EOV> <SOV> And some of those who stood by , when they heard [ it ] , said , Behold , he calls for Elias . <EOV> <SOV> And one , running and filling a sponge with vinegar , fixed it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone , let us see if Elias comes to take him down . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having uttered a loud cry , expired . <EOV> <SOV> And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom . <EOV> <SOV> And the centurion who stood by over against him , when he saw that he had expired having thus cried out , said , Truly this man was Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And there were women also looking on from afar off , among whom were both Mary of Magdala , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ; <EOV> <SOV> who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him and ministered to him ; and many others who came up with him to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was already evening , since it was [ the ] preparation , that is , [ the day ] before a sabbath , <EOV> <SOV> Joseph of Arimathaea , an honourable councillor , who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God , coming , emboldened himself and went in to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate wondered if he were already dead ; and having called to [ him ] the centurion , he inquired of him if he had long died . <EOV> <SOV> And when he knew from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> And having bought fine linen , [ and ] having taken him down , he swathed him in the fine linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of rock , and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary of Magdala and Mary the [ mother ] of Joses saw where he was put . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the sabbath being [ now ] past , Mary of Magdala , and Mary the [ mother ] of James , and Salome , bought aromatic spices that they might come and embalm him . <EOV> <SOV> And very early on the first [ day ] of the week they come to the sepulchre , the sun having risen . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to one another , Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre ? <EOV> <SOV> And when they looked , they see that the stone has been rolled [ away ] , for it was very great . <EOV> <SOV> And entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right , clothed in a white robe , and they were amazed and alarmed ; <EOV> <SOV> but he says to them , Be not alarmed . Ye seek Jesus , the Nazarene , the crucified one . He is risen , he is not here ; behold the place where they had put him . <EOV> <SOV> But go , tell his disciples and Peter , he goes before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him , as he said to you . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out , and fled from the sepulchre . And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them , and they said nothing to any one , for they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he had risen very early , the first [ day ] of the week , he appeared first to Mary of Magdala , out of whom he had cast seven demons . <EOV> <SOV> * She * went and brought word to those that had been with him , [ who were ] grieving and weeping . <EOV> <SOV> And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her , they disbelieved [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked , going into the country ; <EOV> <SOV> and * they * went and brought word to the rest ; neither did they believe them . <EOV> <SOV> Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven , and reproached [ them with ] their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they had not believed those who had seen him risen . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Go into all the world , and preach the glad tidings to all the creation . <EOV> <SOV> He that believes and is baptised shall be saved , and he that disbelieves shall be condemned . <EOV> <SOV> And these signs shall follow those that have believed : in my name they shall cast out demons ; they shall speak with new tongues ; <EOV> <SOV> they shall take up serpents ; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them ; they shall lay hands upon the infirm , and they shall be well . <EOV> <SOV> The Lord therefore , after he had spoken to them , was taken up into heaven , and sat at the right hand of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they , going forth , preached everywhere , the Lord working with [ them ] , and confirming the word by the signs following upon [ it ] . <EOV> <EOC>
