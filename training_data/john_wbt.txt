<SOC> <SOV> In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . <EOV> <SOV> The same was in the beginning with God . <EOV> <SOV> All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made . <EOV> <SOV> In him was life ; and the life was the light of men . <EOV> <SOV> And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not . <EOV> <SOV> There was a man sent from God , whose name was John . <EOV> <SOV> The same came for a witness , to bear testimony of the Light , that all men through him might believe . <EOV> <SOV> He was not that Light , but was sent to bear testimony of that Light . <EOV> <SOV> That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world . <EOV> <SOV> He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not . <EOV> <SOV> He came to his own , and his own received him not . <EOV> <SOV> But as many as received him , to them he gave power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name : <EOV> <SOV> Who were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth . <EOV> <SOV> John testified concerning him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spoke , He that cometh after me , is preferred before me ; for he was before me . <EOV> <SOV> And of his fullness have we all received , and grace for grace . <EOV> <SOV> For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ . <EOV> <SOV> No man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem , to ask him , Who art thou ? <EOV> <SOV> And he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , I am not the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elijah ? and he saith , I am not . Art thou that prophet ? And he answered , No . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they to him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Isaiah . <EOV> <SOV> And they who were sent were of the Pharisees . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , and said to him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou art not that Christ , nor Elijah , neither that prophet ? <EOV> <SOV> John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ; <EOV> <SOV> He it is , who coming after me , is preferred before me , whose shoes ' latchet I am not worthy to unloose . <EOV> <SOV> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing . <EOV> <SOV> The next day John seeth Jesus coming to him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , who taketh away the sin of the world . <EOV> <SOV> This is he of whom I said , after me cometh a man who is preferred before me ; for he was before me . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water . <EOV> <SOV> And John bore testimony , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said to me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining on him , the same is he who baptizeth with the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And I saw and bore testimony , that this is the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Again the next day after , John stood , and two of his disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> And looking upon Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God ! <EOV> <SOV> And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith to them , What seek ye ? They said to him , Rabbi ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master ) where dwellest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour . <EOV> <SOV> One of the two who heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother . <EOV> <SOV> He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith to him , We have found the Messiah ; which is , being interpreted , the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas ; which is , by interpretation , a stone . <EOV> <SOV> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith to him , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter . <EOV> <SOV> Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith to him , We have found him described by Moses in the law , and by the prophets , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> And Nathanael said to him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith to him , Come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile ! <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael saith to him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said to him , Before Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig - tree , I saw thee . <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael answered and said to him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , Because I said to thee , I saw thee under the fig - tree , dost thou believe ? thou shalt see greater things than these . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to him , Verily , verily , I say to you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there . <EOV> <SOV> And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage . <EOV> <SOV> And when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith to him , They have no wine . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? my hour is not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> His mother saith to the servants , Whatever he saith to you , do it . <EOV> <SOV> And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them to the brim . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Draw out now , and bear to the governor of the feast . And they bore it . <EOV> <SOV> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was ; ( but the servants who drew the water knew ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom , <EOV> <SOV> And saith to him , Every man at the beginning presenteth good wine ; and when men have well drank , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now . <EOV> <SOV> This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples ; and they continued there not many days . <EOV> <SOV> And the Jews ' passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> And found in the temple those that sold oxen , and sheep , and doves , and the changers of money , sitting : <EOV> <SOV> And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ; <EOV> <SOV> And said to them that sold doves , Take these things hence : make not my Father 's house a house of merchandise . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples remembered that it was written , The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered the Jews , and said to him , What sign showest thou to us , seeing that thou doest these things ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ? <EOV> <SOV> But he spoke of the temple of his body . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he had risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this to them : and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had spoken . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he performed . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus did not commit himself to them , because he knew all men . <EOV> <SOV> And needed not that any should testify concerning man : for he knew what was in man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews : <EOV> <SOV> The same came to Jesus by night , and said to him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , Verily , verily , I say to thee , Except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith to him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say to thee , Except a man be born of water , and of the Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> That which is born of the flesh , is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit , is spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Marvel not that I said to thee , Ye must be born again . <EOV> <SOV> The wind bloweth where it will , and thou hearest the sound of it , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus answered and said to him , How can these things be ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , Art thou a teacher of Israel , and knowest not these things ? <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to thee , We speak what we know , and testify what we have seen ; and ye receive not our testimony . <EOV> <SOV> If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how will ye believe if I tell you heavenly things ? <EOV> <SOV> And no man hath ascended to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up : <EOV> <SOV> That whoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> For God so loved the world , that he gave his only - begotten Son , that whoever believeth in him , should not perish , but have everlasting life . <EOV> <SOV> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world , but that the world through him may be saved . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on him , is not condemned : but he that believeth not , is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only - begotten Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men have loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved . <EOV> <SOV> But he that doeth truth , cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God . <EOV> <SOV> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized . <EOV> <SOV> And John also was baptizing in Enon , near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized . <EOV> <SOV> For John was not yet cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> Then there arose a question between some of John 's disciples and the Jews , about purifying . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to John , and said to him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou didst bear testimony , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him . <EOV> <SOV> John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Ye yourselves bear me testimony , that I said I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath the bride , is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , who standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly , because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> He must increase , but I must decrease . <EOV> <SOV> He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all . <EOV> <SOV> And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath received his testimony , hath set to his seal that God is true . <EOV> <SOV> For he whom God hath sent , speaketh the words of God : for to him God giveth not the Spirit by measure . <EOV> <SOV> The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on the Son , hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son , shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John , <EOV> <SOV> ( Though Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , ) <EOV> <SOV> He left Judea , and departed again into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And he must needs go through Samaria . <EOV> <SOV> Then he cometh to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground , that Jacob gave to his son Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour . <EOV> <SOV> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith to her , Give me to drink . <EOV> <SOV> ( For his disciples had gone to the city to buy provisions . ) <EOV> <SOV> Then saith the woman of Samaria to him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , who am a woman of Samaria ? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldst have asked him , and he would have given thee living water . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith to him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ? <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , and his children , and his cattle ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to her , Whoever drinketh of this water , shall thirst again : <EOV> <SOV> But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him , shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him , shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith to him , Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst , neither come hither to draw . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither . <EOV> <SOV> The woman answered and said , I have no husband . Jesus said to her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband : <EOV> <SOV> For thou hast had five husbands , and he whom thou now hast , is not thy husband : in that thou hast spoken truth . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith to him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers worshiped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship , for salvation is from the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him . <EOV> <SOV> God is a Spirit : and they that worship him , must worship him in spirit and in truth . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith to him , I know that Messiah cometh , who is called Christ ; when he is come , he will tell us all things . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , I that speak to thee am he . <EOV> <SOV> And upon this came his disciples , and marveled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why talkest thou with her ? <EOV> <SOV> The woman then left her waterpot , and went into the city , and saith to the men , <EOV> <SOV> Come , see a man who hath told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they went out of the city , and came to him . <EOV> <SOV> In the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , I have food to eat that ye know not of . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him aught to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , My food is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work . <EOV> <SOV> Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , I say to you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest . <EOV> <SOV> And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit to life eternal : that both he that soweth , and he that reapeth , may rejoice together . <EOV> <SOV> And herein is that saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth . <EOV> <SOV> I sent you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor : other men labored , and ye have entered into their labors . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , who testified , He told me all that ever I did . <EOV> <SOV> So when the Samaritans had come to him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days . <EOV> <SOV> And many more believed , because of his own word ; <EOV> <SOV> And said to the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Savior of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country . <EOV> <SOV> Then when he had come into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went to the feast . <EOV> <SOV> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee , he went to him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> The nobleman saith to him , Sir , come down ere my child dieth . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , Go ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him , and he departed . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth . <EOV> <SOV> Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend : and they said to him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . <EOV> <SOV> So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him , Thy son liveth : and he himself believed , and his whole house . <EOV> <SOV> This is again the second miracle that Jesus performed , when he had come from Judea into Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After this there was a feast of the Jews : and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue , Bethesda , having five porches . <EOV> <SOV> In these lay a great multitude of impotent persons , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water . <EOV> <SOV> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and agitated the water : whoever then first after the stirring of the water stepped in , was cured of whatever disease he had . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain man was there , who had an infirmity thirty and eight years . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus saw him lying , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith to him , Wilt thou be healed ? <EOV> <SOV> The impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is agitated , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , Rise , take up thy bed , and walk . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the man was healed , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said to him that was cured , it is the sabbath ; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed . <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , He that healed me , the same said to me , Take up thy bed , and walk . <EOV> <SOV> Then they asked him , What man is that who said to thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> And he that was healed knew not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place . <EOV> <SOV> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said to him , Behold , thou art cured : sin no more , lest a worse thing come to thee . <EOV> <SOV> The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him . <EOV> <SOV> And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , and I work . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father , making himself equal with God . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered Jesus , and said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , The Son can do nothing by himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for whatever things he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . <EOV> <SOV> For the Father loveth the Son , and showeth him all things that himself doeth : and he will show him greater works than these , that ye may marvel . <EOV> <SOV> For as the Father raiseth the dead , and reviveth them ; even so the Son reviveth whom he will . <EOV> <SOV> For the Father judgeth no man ; but hath committed all judgment to the Son : <EOV> <SOV> That all men should honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . He that honoreth not the Son , honoreth not the Father who hath sent him . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but hath passed from death to life . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live . <EOV> <SOV> For as the Father hath life in himself , so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ; <EOV> <SOV> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice , <EOV> <SOV> And shall come forth ; they that have done good to the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , to the resurrection of damnation . <EOV> <SOV> I can of my own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not my own will , but the will of the Father who hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I testify concerning myself , my testimony is not true . <EOV> <SOV> There is another that testifieth concerning me , and I know that the testimony which he beareth concerning me is true . <EOV> <SOV> Ye sent to John , and he testified to the truth . <EOV> <SOV> But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye may be saved . <EOV> <SOV> He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light . <EOV> <SOV> But I have greater testimony than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear testimony concerning me , that the Father hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the Father himself who hath sent me , hath borne testimony concerning me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape . <EOV> <SOV> And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not . <EOV> <SOV> Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will not come to me , that ye may have life . <EOV> <SOV> I receive not honor from men . <EOV> <SOV> But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you . <EOV> <SOV> I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive . <EOV> <SOV> How can ye believe , who receive honor one from another , and seek not the honor that cometh from God only ? <EOV> <SOV> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust . <EOV> <SOV> For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me : for he wrote concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias . <EOV> <SOV> And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he performed on them that were diseased . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went upon a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come to him , he saith to Philip , Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat ? <EOV> <SOV> ( And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do . ) <EOV> <SOV> Philip answered him , Two hundred penny - worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them make take a little : <EOV> <SOV> One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , saith to him , <EOV> <SOV> There is a lad here , who hath five barley - loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . ( Now there was much grass in the place . ) So the men sat down in number about five thousand . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes , as much as they would . <EOV> <SOV> When they were satisfied , he said to his disciples , Gather the fragments that remain , that nothing may be lost . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore they gathered them , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley - loaves , which remained over and above to them that had eaten . <EOV> <SOV> Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus performed , said , This is truly that prophet that should come into the world . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again to a mountain himself alone . <EOV> <SOV> And when evening had now come , his disciples went down to the sea , <EOV> <SOV> And entered into a boat , and went over the sea towards Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus had not come to them . <EOV> <SOV> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew . <EOV> <SOV> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh to the boat : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> But he saith to them , It is I ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> Then they willingly received him into the boat : and immediately the boat was at the land whither they were going . <EOV> <SOV> The day following , when the people who stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , save that one into which his disciples had entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples had gone away alone ; <EOV> <SOV> ( Yet there came other boats from Tiberias nigh to the place where they ate bread , after the Lord had given thanks : ) <EOV> <SOV> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye ate of the loaves , and were satisfied . <EOV> <SOV> Labor not for the food which perisheth , but for that food which endureth to everlasting life , which the Son of man will give to you : for him hath God the Father sealed . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they to him , What shall we do , that we may work the works of God ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , What sign showest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ? <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers ate manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For the bread of God is he who cometh down from heaven , and giveth life to the world . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they to him , Lord , evermore give us this bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me , shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me , shall never thirst . <EOV> <SOV> But I said to you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not . <EOV> <SOV> All that the Father giveth me , shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me , I will in no wise reject . <EOV> <SOV> For I came down from heaven , not to do my own will , but the will of him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the Father 's will who hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me , I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one who seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews then murmured at him , because he said , I am the bread which came down from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answered and said to them , Murmur not among yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> No man can come to me , except the Father who hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught from God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned from the Father , cometh to me . <EOV> <SOV> Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he who is from God , he hath seen the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life . <EOV> <SOV> I am that bread of life . <EOV> <SOV> Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness , and are dead . <EOV> <SOV> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat of it , and not die . <EOV> <SOV> I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man shall eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore contended among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For my flesh is food indeed , and my blood is drink indeed . <EOV> <SOV> He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me . <EOV> <SOV> This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers ate manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever . <EOV> <SOV> These things he said in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is a hard saying ; who can hear it ? <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said to them , Doth this offend you ? <EOV> <SOV> What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ? <EOV> <SOV> It is the spirit that reviveth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak to you , they are spirit , and they are life . <EOV> <SOV> But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who he was that would betray him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Therefore I said to you , that no man can come to me , except it were given to him by my Father . <EOV> <SOV> From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to the twelve , Will ye also go away ? <EOV> <SOV> Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> And we believe , and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ? <EOV> <SOV> He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for it was he that was to betray him , being one of the twelve . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Judea , because the Jews sought to kill him . <EOV> <SOV> Now the Jews ' feast of tabernacles was at hand . <EOV> <SOV> His brethren therefore said to him , Depart hence , and go into Judea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest . <EOV> <SOV> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou doest these things , show thyself to the world . <EOV> <SOV> ( For neither did his brethren believe in him . ) <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said to them , My time is not yet come : but your time is always ready . <EOV> <SOV> The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify concerning it , that its works are evil . <EOV> <SOV> Go ye up to this feast : I go not yet to this feast , for my time is not yet full come . <EOV> <SOV> When he had said these words to them , he abode still in Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But when his brethren had gone up , then he went also to the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret . <EOV> <SOV> Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ? <EOV> <SOV> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , No ; but he deceiveth the people . <EOV> <SOV> Yet , no man spoke openly of him , for fear of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Now about the midst of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple , and taught . <EOV> <SOV> And the Jews marveled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If any man will do his will , he shall know concerning the doctrine , whether it is from God , or whether I speak from myself . <EOV> <SOV> He that speaketh from himself , seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him . <EOV> <SOV> Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ? <EOV> <SOV> The people answered and said , Thou hast a demon : who goeth about to kill thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel . <EOV> <SOV> Moses therefore gave to you circumcision , ( not because it is from Moses , but from the fathers ) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man . <EOV> <SOV> If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment . <EOV> <SOV> Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ? <EOV> <SOV> But lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing to him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> But we know this man , whence he is : whereas when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> Then cried Jesus in the temple , as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not . <EOV> <SOV> But I know him ; for I am from him , and he hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ? <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him : and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go to him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Ye will seek me , and will not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ? <EOV> <SOV> What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye will seek me , and will not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come ? <EOV> <SOV> In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirsteth , let him come to me , and drink . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . <EOV> <SOV> ( But this he spoke of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive , for the Holy Spirit was not yet given , because that Jesus was not yet glorified . ) <EOV> <SOV> Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , In truth this is the Prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Will Christ come out of Galilee ? <EOV> <SOV> Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh from the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ? <EOV> <SOV> So there was a division among the people because of him . <EOV> <SOV> And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said to them , Why have ye not brought him ? <EOV> <SOV> The officers answered , Never man spoke like this man . <EOV> <SOV> Then the Pharisees answered them , Are ye also deceived ? <EOV> <SOV> Have any of the rulers , or of the Pharisees believed on him ? <EOV> <SOV> But this people who know not the law are cursed . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith to them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them ) <EOV> <SOV> Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him , and knoweth what he doeth ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , Art thou also from Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And every man went to his own house . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Jesus went to the mount of Olives : <EOV> <SOV> And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him ; and he sat down and taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery : and when they had set her in the midst , <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act . <EOV> <SOV> Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned ; but what sayest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not . <EOV> <SOV> So when they continued asking him , he raised himself , and said to them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her . <EOV> <SOV> And again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And they who heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even to the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus had raised himself , and saw none but the woman , he said to her , Woman , where are those thy accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ? <EOV> <SOV> She said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said to her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus spoke again to them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said to him , Thou testifiest concerning thyself ; thy testimony is not true . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , Though I testify concerning myself , yet my testimony is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye can not tell whence I come , and whither I go . <EOV> <SOV> Ye judge after the flesh , I judge no man . <EOV> <SOV> And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true . <EOV> <SOV> I am one that testifieth concerning myself ; and the Father that sent me , testifieth concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they to him , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor my Father : if ye had known me , ye would have known my Father also . <EOV> <SOV> These words Jesus spoke in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him , for his hour was not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus again to them , I am going away , and ye will seek me , and will die in your sins : whither I go , ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews , will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world . <EOV> <SOV> I said therefore to you , that ye will die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye will die in your sins . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they to him , Who art thou ? And Jesus saith to them , Even the same that I said to you from the beginning . <EOV> <SOV> I have many things to say , and to judge of you : but he that sent me , is true : and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him . <EOV> <SOV> They understood not that he spoke to them concerning the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him . <EOV> <SOV> As he spoke these words , many believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him , If ye continue in my word , ye are my disciples indeed ; <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , We are Abraham 's offspring , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say to you , Whoever committeth sin , is the servant of sin . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever , but the Son abideth for ever . <EOV> <SOV> If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed . <EOV> <SOV> I know that ye are Abraham 's offspring ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you . <EOV> <SOV> I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith to them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard from God : this did not Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Ye do the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We are not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye can not hear my word . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do : he was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it . <EOV> <SOV> And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not . <EOV> <SOV> Which of you convicteth me of sin ? And if I speak the truth , why do ye not believe me ? <EOV> <SOV> He that is of God , heareth God 's words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered the Jews , and said to him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a demon ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I have not a demon ; but I honor my Father , and ye dishonor me . <EOV> <SOV> And I seek not my own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , If a man shall keep my saying , he shall never see death . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews to him , Now we know that thou hast a demon . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man shall keep my saying , he shall never taste death . <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , If I honor myself , my honor is nothing : it is my Father that honoreth me , of whom ye say , that he is your God : <EOV> <SOV> Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I should be a liar like you : but I know him , and keep his saying . <EOV> <SOV> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews to him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , Before Abraham was , I am . <EOV> <SOV> Then they took up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as Jesus passed by , he saw a man who was blind from his birth . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who sinned , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him . <EOV> <SOV> I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh when no man can work . <EOV> <SOV> As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world . <EOV> <SOV> When he had thus spoken , he spit on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay , <EOV> <SOV> And said to him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went therefore , and washed , and came seeing . <EOV> <SOV> The neighbors therefore , and they who before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ? <EOV> <SOV> Some said , This is he : others said , He is like him : but he said , I am he . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore they said to him , How were thy eyes opened ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , A man that is called Jesus , made clay , and anointed my eyes , and said to me , Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they to him , Where is he ? He said , I know not . <EOV> <SOV> They brought to the Pharisees him that before was blind . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the sabbath when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes . <EOV> <SOV> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . He said to them , He put clay upon my eyes , and I washed , and do see . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not from God , because he keepeth not the sabbath . Others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? And there was a division among them . <EOV> <SOV> They say to the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thy eyes ? He said , He is a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> But the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked them , saying , Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ? <EOV> <SOV> His parents answered them and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind : <EOV> <SOV> But by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he will speak for himself . <EOV> <SOV> These words his parents spoke , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man confessed that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him . <EOV> <SOV> Then again they called the man that was blind , and said to him , Give God the praise : we know that this man is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , Whether he is a sinner , I know not : one thing I know , that whereas I was blind , now I see . <EOV> <SOV> Then they said to him again , What did he to thee ? how opened he thy eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , I have told you already , and ye did not hear : Why would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are the disciples of Moses . <EOV> <SOV> We know that God spoke to Moses : as for this man , we know not whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> The man answered and said to them , Why , herein is a marvelous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened my eyes . <EOV> <SOV> Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man is a worshiper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth . <EOV> <SOV> Since the world began hath it not been heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind . <EOV> <SOV> If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? and they cast him out . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus heard that they had cast him out : and when he had found him , he said to him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I may believe on him ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Lord , I believe . And he worshiped him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they who see not , may see ; and that they who see , may be made blind . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words , and said to him , Are we blind also ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , If ye were blind , ye would have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheep - fold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber . <EOV> <SOV> But he that entereth by the door , is the shepherd of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice . <EOV> <SOV> And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers . <EOV> <SOV> This parable spoke Jesus to them : but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them again , Verily , verily , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them . <EOV> <SOV> I am the door : by me if any man shall enter he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture . <EOV> <SOV> The thief cometh not , but to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they may have life , and that they may have it more abundantly . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> But he that is a hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth , and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> The hireling fleeth , because he is a hireling , and careth not for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known by mine . <EOV> <SOV> As the Father knoweth me , even so I know the Father : and I lay down my life for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> And other sheep I have which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again . <EOV> <SOV> No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received from my Father . <EOV> <SOV> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings . <EOV> <SOV> And many of them said , He hath a demon , and is insane ; why hear ye him ? <EOV> <SOV> Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? <EOV> <SOV> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon 's porch . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the Jews around him , and said to him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou art the Christ , tell us plainly . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I did in my Father 's name , they testify concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said to you . <EOV> <SOV> My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me : <EOV> <SOV> And I give to them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any pluck them out of my hand . <EOV> <SOV> My Father , who gave them to me , is greater than all ; and none is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand . <EOV> <SOV> I and my Father are one . <EOV> <SOV> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shown you from my Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ? <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , saying , For a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy , and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ? <EOV> <SOV> If he called them gods , to whom the word of God came , and the scripture can not be broken ; <EOV> <SOV> Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not . <EOV> <SOV> But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore they sought again to take him ; but he escaped from their hand , <EOV> <SOV> And went again beyond Jordan , into the place where John at first baptized ; and there he abode . <EOV> <SOV> And many resorted to him , and said , John performed no miracle ; but all things that John spoke of this man were true . <EOV> <SOV> And many believed on him there . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now a certain man was sick , named Lazarus , of Bethany , the town of Mary and her sister Martha . <EOV> <SOV> ( It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . ) <EOV> <SOV> Therefore his sisters sent to him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not to death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified by it . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he had heard that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was . <EOV> <SOV> Then after that he saith to his disciples , Let us ho into Judea again . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say to him , Master , the Jews of late sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walketh in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world . <EOV> <SOV> But if a man walketh in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him . <EOV> <SOV> These things he said : and after that he saith to them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep . <EOV> <SOV> Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleepeth he will do well . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus spoke of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest in sleep . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them plainly , Lazarus is dead . <EOV> <SOV> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless , let us go to him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Thomas , who is called Didymus , to his fellow - disciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already . <EOV> <SOV> ( Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs distant . ) <EOV> <SOV> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother . <EOV> <SOV> Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Martha to Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . <EOV> <SOV> But I know that even now , whatever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Thy brother shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Martha saith to him , I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : <EOV> <SOV> And whoever liveth , and believeth in me , shall never die . Believest thou this ? <EOV> <SOV> She saith to him , Yes , Lord , I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , who was to come into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And when she had so said , she went and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee . <EOV> <SOV> As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came to him . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus had not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews then who were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary that she rose hastily , and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth to the grave to weep there . <EOV> <SOV> Then when Mary had come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled ; <EOV> <SOV> And said , Where have ye laid him ? They say to him , Lord , come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus wept . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews , Behold how he loved him ! <EOV> <SOV> And some of them said , Could not this man , who opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself , cometh to the grave . It was a cave , and a stone lay upon it . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith to him , Lord , by this time his body is offensive : for he hath been dead four days . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Said I not to thee , that if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me : <EOV> <SOV> And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people who stand by , I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with grave - clothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith to them , Loose him , and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> Then many of the Jews who came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them went to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done . <EOV> <SOV> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council , and said , What do we ? for this man performeth many miracles . <EOV> <SOV> If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans will come , and take away both our place and nation . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said to them , Ye know nothing at all , <EOV> <SOV> Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not . <EOV> <SOV> And this he spoke not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ; <EOV> <SOV> And not for that nation only , but that also he should assemble in one the children of God that were scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence to a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves . <EOV> <SOV> Then they sought for Jesus , and spoke among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ? <EOV> <SOV> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he was , he should show it , that they might take him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Jesus , six days before the passover , came to Bethany , where Lazarus was who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , who was to betray him , <EOV> <SOV> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ? <EOV> <SOV> This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bore what was put in it . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burial hath she kept this . <EOV> <SOV> For the poor ye have always with you ; but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> Many people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ; <EOV> <SOV> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> On the next day , many people that had come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> Took branches of palm - trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna ; Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written , <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt . <EOV> <SOV> These things his disciples understood not at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written concerning him , and that they had done these things to him . <EOV> <SOV> The people therefore that were with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bore testimony . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him . <EOV> <SOV> And there were certain Greeks among them , that came to worship at the feast . <EOV> <SOV> The same came therefore to Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again , Andrew and Philip tell Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world , shall keep it to life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honor . <EOV> <SOV> Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause I came to this hour . <EOV> <SOV> Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . <EOV> <SOV> The people therefore that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered . Others said , An angel spoke to him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes . <EOV> <SOV> Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out . <EOV> <SOV> And I , if I shall be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men to me . <EOV> <SOV> ( This he said , signifying what death he should die . ) <EOV> <SOV> The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of man ? <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said to them , Yet a little while is the light with you . Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth . <EOV> <SOV> While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spoke Jesus , and departed , and concealed himself from them . <EOV> <SOV> But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him : <EOV> <SOV> That the saying of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spoke , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore they could not believe , because that Isaiah said again , <EOV> <SOV> He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them . <EOV> <SOV> These things said Isaiah , when he saw his glory , and spoke of him . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless , among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue : <EOV> <SOV> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus cried , and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me : <EOV> <SOV> And he that seeth me , seeth him that sent me : <EOV> <SOV> I am come a light into the world , that whoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world . <EOV> <SOV> He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For I have not spoken from myself ; but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak . <EOV> <SOV> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatever I speak therefore , even as the Father said to me , so I speak . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end . <EOV> <SOV> And supper being ended ( the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ; ) <EOV> <SOV> Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he had come from God , and was going to God ; <EOV> <SOV> He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself . <EOV> <SOV> After that , he poured water into a basin , and began to wash the disciples feet , and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded . <EOV> <SOV> Then he cometh to Simon Peter : and Peter saith to him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter . <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith to him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith to him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is wholly clean : and ye are clean , but not all . <EOV> <SOV> For he knew who would betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean . <EOV> <SOV> So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said to them , Know ye what I have done to you ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye call me Master , and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am . <EOV> <SOV> If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another 's feet . <EOV> <SOV> For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him . <EOV> <SOV> If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them . <EOV> <SOV> I speak not of you all ; I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me , hath lifted up his heel against me . <EOV> <SOV> Now I tell you before it cometh , that when it hath come to pass , ye may believe that I am he . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send , receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me , receiveth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , that one of you will betray me . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spoke . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom , one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , to ask who it should be of whom he spoke . <EOV> <SOV> He then lying on Jesus ' breast , saith to him , Lord , who is it ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , He it is to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon . <EOV> <SOV> And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus to him , What thou doest , do quickly . <EOV> <SOV> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him . <EOV> <SOV> For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said to him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor . <EOV> <SOV> He then having received the sop , went immediately out : and it was night . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore when he had gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him . <EOV> <SOV> If God is glorified in him , God will also glorify him in himself , and will immediately glorify him . <EOV> <SOV> Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye will seek me : and , as I said to the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say to you . <EOV> <SOV> A new commandment I give to you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . <EOV> <SOV> By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter said to him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterward . <EOV> <SOV> Peter said to him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say to thee , The cock will not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me . <EOV> <SOV> In my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you . <EOV> <SOV> And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again and receive you to myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also . <EOV> <SOV> And whither I go ye know , and the way ye know . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas saith to him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , I am the way , and the truth , and the life : no man cometh to the Father , but by me . <EOV> <SOV> If ye had known me , ye would have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him . <EOV> <SOV> Philip saith to him , Lord , show us the Father , and it sufficeth us . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me Philip ? he that hath seen me , hath seen the Father ; and how sayest thou then , Show us the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak to you , I speak not from myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works . <EOV> <SOV> Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , he that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go to my Father . <EOV> <SOV> And whatever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son . <EOV> <SOV> If ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it . <EOV> <SOV> If ye love me , keep my commandments . <EOV> <SOV> And I will pray the Father , and he will give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ; <EOV> <SOV> Even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world can not receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and will be in you . <EOV> <SOV> I will not leave you comfortless ; I will come to you . <EOV> <SOV> Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also . <EOV> <SOV> At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me , shall be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him . <EOV> <SOV> Judas , not Iscariot , saith to him , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us , and not to the world ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , If a man loveth me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come to him , and make our abode with him . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth me not , keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but that of the Father who sent me . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken to you , being yet present with you . <EOV> <SOV> But the Comforter , who is the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatever I have said to you . <EOV> <SOV> Peace I leave with you , my peace I give to you : not as the world giveth , give I to you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that I said to you , I go away , and come again to you . If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go to the Father : for my Father is greater than I. <EOV> <SOV> And now I have told you before it cometh to pass , that when it hath come to pass , ye may believe . <EOV> <SOV> Hereafter I will not talk much with you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in me . <EOV> <SOV> But that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . Arise , let us go hence . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman . <EOV> <SOV> Every branch in me that beareth not fruit , he taketh away ; and every branch that beareth fruit , he cleaneth it , that it my bring forth more fruit . <EOV> <SOV> Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken to you . <EOV> <SOV> Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine : no more can ye , except ye abide in me . <EOV> <SOV> I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> If a man abideth not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered : and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned . <EOV> <SOV> If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye may ask what ye will , and it shall be done to you . <EOV> <SOV> In this is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples . <EOV> <SOV> As the Father hath loved me , so have I loved you : continue ye in my love . <EOV> <SOV> If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be full . <EOV> <SOV> This is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you . <EOV> <SOV> Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are my friends , if ye do whatever I command you . <EOV> <SOV> Henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard from my Father , I have made known to you . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you . <EOV> <SOV> These things I command you , that ye love one another . <EOV> <SOV> If the world hateth you , ye know that it hated me before it hated you . <EOV> <SOV> If ye were of the world , the world would love its own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you . <EOV> <SOV> Remember the word that I said to you , The servant is not greater than his lord . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you : if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also . <EOV> <SOV> But all these things will they do to you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not come and spoken to them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloke for their sin . <EOV> <SOV> He that hateth me , hateth my Father also . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not done among them the works which no other man hath done , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen , and hated both me and my Father . <EOV> <SOV> But this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , They hated me without a cause . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send to you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , who proceedeth from the Father , he will testify concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> And ye also shall bear testimony , because ye have been with me from the beginning . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things have I spoken to you , that ye should not be offended . <EOV> <SOV> They shall put you out of the synagogues : yes , the time cometh , that whoever killeth you , will think that he doeth God service . <EOV> <SOV> And these things will they do to you , because they have not known the Father , nor me . <EOV> <SOV> But these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . And these things I said not to you at the beginning , because I was with you . <EOV> <SOV> But now I go to him that sent me , and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> But because I have said these things to you , sorrow hath filled your heart . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless , I tell you the truth : It is expedient for you that I depart ; for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come to you ; but if I depart , I will send him to you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment : <EOV> <SOV> Of sin , because they believe not on me ; <EOV> <SOV> Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ; <EOV> <SOV> Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged . <EOV> <SOV> I have yet many things to say to you , but ye can not bear them now . <EOV> <SOV> But , when he , the Spirit of truth is come , he will guide you into all the truth : for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he shall hear , that will he speak : and he will show you things to come . <EOV> <SOV> He will glorify me : for he will receive of mine , and will show it to you . <EOV> <SOV> All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore I said , that he will take of mine , and show it to you . <EOV> <SOV> A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith to us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we can not tell what he saith . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said to them , Do ye inquire among yourselves of that which I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ? <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , that ye will weep and lament , but the world will rejoice : and ye will be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy . <EOV> <SOV> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you . <EOV> <SOV> And in that day ye will ask me nothing : Verily , verily , I say to you , Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you . <EOV> <SOV> Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken to you in proverbs : but the time cometh when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs , but I shall show you plainly concerning the Father . <EOV> <SOV> At that day ye will ask in my name : and I say not to you , that I will pray the Father for you : <EOV> <SOV> For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came from God . <EOV> <SOV> I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples said to him , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no proverb . <EOV> <SOV> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest from God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold , the hour cometh , and is even now come , that ye shall be scattered every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me . <EOV> <SOV> These things I have spoken to you , that in me ye may have peace . In the world ye will have tribulation , but be of good cheer : I have overcome the world . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These words spoke Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee : <EOV> <SOV> As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him . <EOV> <SOV> And this is life eternal , that they may know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent . <EOV> <SOV> I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do . <EOV> <SOV> And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thy ownself , with the glory which I had with thee before the world was . <EOV> <SOV> I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest to me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them to me ; and they have kept thy word . <EOV> <SOV> Now they have known that all things whatever thou hast given me are from thee . <EOV> <SOV> For I have given to them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me . <EOV> <SOV> I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them whom thou hast given to me ; for they are thine . <EOV> <SOV> And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them . <EOV> <SOV> And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thy own name those whom thou hast given to me , that they may be one , as we are . <EOV> <SOV> While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest to me I have kept , and none of them is lost but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And now I come to thee , and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves . <EOV> <SOV> I have given to them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world , but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil . <EOV> <SOV> They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth . <EOV> <SOV> As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also may be sanctified through the truth . <EOV> <SOV> Neither pray I for these alone ; but for them also who shall believe on me through their word . <EOV> <SOV> That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the glory which thou gavest to me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , even as we are one . <EOV> <SOV> I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them as thou hast loved me . <EOV> <SOV> Father , I will that they also whom thou hast given to me be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory which thou hast given to me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world . <EOV> <SOV> O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And I have declared to them thy name , and will declare it : that the love with which thou hast loved me , may be in them , and I in them . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kedron , where was a garden , into which he entered , and his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas also , who betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns , and torches , and weapons . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore , knowing all things that were coming upon him , went forth , and said to them , Whom seek ye ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith to them , I am he . And Judas also , who betrayed him , stood with them . <EOV> <SOV> As soon then as he had said to them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground . <EOV> <SOV> Then he asked them again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he : If therefore ye seek me , let these go away : <EOV> <SOV> That the saying might be fulfilled which he spoke , Of them whom thou gavest to me , I have lost none . <EOV> <SOV> Then Simon Peter , having a sword , drew it , and smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear . The servant 's name was Malchus . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ? <EOV> <SOV> Then the band , and the captain , and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him , <EOV> <SOV> And led him away to Annas first , ( for he was father - in - law to Caiaphas , who was the high priest that same year . ) <EOV> <SOV> Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple . That disciple was known to the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out that other disciple who was known to the high priest , and spoke to her that kept the door , and brought in Peter . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith the damsel that kept the door to Peter , Art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? He saith , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; ( for it was cold ) and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself . <EOV> <SOV> The high priest then asked Jesus concerning his disciples , and concerning his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , I spoke openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Why dost thou ask me ? ask them who heard me , what I have said to them : behold , they know what I have said . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , one of the officers who stood by , struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear testimony of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ? <EOV> <SOV> ( Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest . ) <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . They said therefore to him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? He denied it , and said , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> One of the servants of the high priest ( being the kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off ) saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter then denied again , and immediately the cock crowed . <EOV> <SOV> Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment - hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate then went out to them , and said , What accusation bring ye against this man ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , If he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up to thee . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Pilate to them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said to him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death : <EOV> <SOV> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spoke , signifying what death he should die . <EOV> <SOV> Then Pilate entered into the judgment - hall again , and called Jesus , and said to him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing from thyself , or did others tell it thee concerning me ? <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thy own nation , and the chief priests , have delivered thee to me : What hast thou done ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore said to him , Art thou a King then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a King . To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should testify to the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate saith to him , What is truth ? And when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews , and saith to them , I find in him no fault . <EOV> <SOV> But ye have a custom that I should release to you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they all cried again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and scourged him . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe , <EOV> <SOV> And said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they smote him with their hands . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith to them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus came forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . And Pilate saith to them , Behold the man ! <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith to them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ; <EOV> <SOV> And went again into the judgment - hall , and saith to Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Pilate to him , Speakest thou not to me ? knowest thou not , that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Thou couldst have no power against me ; except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me to thee hath the greater sin . <EOV> <SOV> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Cesar 's friend . Whoever maketh himself a king , speaketh against Cesar . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down on the judgment - seat , in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith to the Jews , Behold your King ! <EOV> <SOV> But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith to them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Cesar . <EOV> <SOV> Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away . <EOV> <SOV> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew , Golgotha : <EOV> <SOV> Where they crucified him , and two others with him , on each side one , and Jesus in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was , JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> Many of the Jews then read this title : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , Greek , and Latin . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , What I have written , I have written . <EOV> <SOV> Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did . <EOV> <SOV> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus , his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith to his mother , Woman , behold thy son ! <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home . <EOV> <SOV> After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and expired . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath , ( for that sabbath was a great day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the soldiers , and broke the legs of the first , and of the other who was crucified with him . <EOV> <SOV> But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they broke not his legs : <EOV> <SOV> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came out blood and water . <EOV> <SOV> And he that saw it , testified , and his testimony is true : and he knoweth that he speaketh truth , that ye may believe . <EOV> <SOV> For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken . <EOV> <SOV> And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced . <EOV> <SOV> And after this , Joseph of Arimathea ( being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews ) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore and took the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And there came also Nicodemus ( who at the first came to Jesus by night ) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pound weight . <EOV> <SOV> Then they took the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen cloths , with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the place where he was crucified , there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulcher , in which was never man yet laid . <EOV> <SOV> There they laid Jesus therefore , because of the Jews ' preparation - day , for the sepulcher was nigh at hand . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , to the sepulcher , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and saith to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher , and we know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> So they ran both together : and the other disciple outran Peter , and came first to the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> And he stooping down , saw the linen cloths lying ; yet he went not in . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulcher , and seeth the linen cloths lying ; <EOV> <SOV> And the napkin that was about his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but wrapped together in a place by itself . <EOV> <SOV> Then went in also that other disciple who came first to the sepulcher , and he saw , and believed . <EOV> <SOV> For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples went away again to their own home . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping : and as she wept she stooped down to look into the sepulcher , <EOV> <SOV> And seeth two angels in white , sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain . <EOV> <SOV> And they say to her , Woman , why weepest thou ? she saith to them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> And when she had thus said , she turned herself about , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith to him , Sir , if thou hast borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Mary . She turned herself , and saith to him , Rabboni , which is to say , Master . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Touch me not : for I have not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say to them , I ascend to my Father and your Father , and to my God and your God . <EOV> <SOV> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had spoken these things to her . <EOV> <SOV> Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and saith to them , Peace be to you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had so said , he showed to them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be to you : as my Father hath sent me , even so I send you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith to them , Receive ye the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted to them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained . <EOV> <SOV> But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came . <EOV> <SOV> The other disciples therefore said to him , We have seen the Lord . But he said to them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be to you . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side ; and be not faithless , but believing . <EOV> <SOV> And Thomas answered and said to him , My Lord and my God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , Thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed . <EOV> <SOV> And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book . <EOV> <SOV> But these are written , that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing ye may have life through his name . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias : and in this manner did he show himself . <EOV> <SOV> There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith to them , I go a fishing . They say to him , We also go with thee . They went forth , and entered into a boat immediately ; and that night they caught nothing . <EOV> <SOV> But when the morning had now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus saith to them , Children , have ye any victuals ? They answered him , No . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith to Peter , It is the Lord . Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt on his fisher 's coat , ( for he was naked ) and cast himself into the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And the other disciples came in a little boat ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits ) dragging the net with fishes . <EOV> <SOV> As soon then as they had come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid upon them , and bread . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , Bring of the fish which ye have now caught . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , a hundred and fifty and three : and notwithstanding there were so many , yet the net was not broken . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , Come and dine . And none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus then cometh , and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish likewise . <EOV> <SOV> This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> So when they had dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon son of Jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? He saith to him , Yes , Lord : thou knowest that I love thee . He saith to him , Feed my lambs . <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him again the second time , Simon son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? He saith to him , Yes , Lord : thou knowest that I love thee . He saith to him , Feed my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him the third time , Simon son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved , because he said to him the third time , Lovest thou me ? And he said to him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I love thee . Jesus saith to him , Feed my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to thee , When thou wast young , thou didst gird thyself and walk whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldst not . <EOV> <SOV> This he spoke , signifying by what death he should glorify God . And when he had spoken this , he saith to him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter turning about , seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved , following ; ( who also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , Lord , who is he that betrayeth thee ? ) <EOV> <SOV> Peter seeing him , saith to Jesus , Lord , and what shall this man do ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , If I will that he shall tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? Follow thou me . <EOV> <SOV> Then this saying went abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet Jesus said not to him , He shall not die ; but , if I will that he shall tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> This is the disciple who testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true . <EOV> <SOV> And there are also many other things which Jesus did , which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
