<SOC> <SOV> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us , <EOV> <SOV> even as they delivered them unto us , who from the beginning wer eyewitnesses and ministers of the word , <EOV> <SOV> it seemed good to me also , having traced the course of all things accurately from the first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ; <EOV> <SOV> that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed . <EOV> <SOV> There was in the days of Herod , king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abijah : and he had a wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless . <EOV> <SOV> And they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were ' now ' well stricken in years . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came to pass , while he executed the priest 's office before God in the order of his course , <EOV> <SOV> according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense . <EOV> <SOV> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of altar of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias was troubled when he saw ' him ' , and fear fell upon him . <EOV> <SOV> But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : because thy supplication is heard , and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John . <EOV> <SOV> And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth . <EOV> <SOV> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother 's womb . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the children of Israel shall be turn unto the Lord their God . <EOV> <SOV> And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient ' to walk ' in the wisdom of the just ; to make ready for the Lord a people prepared ' for him ' . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias said unto the angel , Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and I was sent to speak unto thee , and to bring thee these good tidings . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , thou shalt be silent and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall come to pass , because thou believedst not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season . <EOV> <SOV> And the people were waiting for Zacharias , and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : and he continued making signs unto them , and remained dumb . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the days of his ministration were fulfilled , he departed unto his house . <EOV> <SOV> And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived ; and she hid herself five months , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Thus hath the Lord done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon ' me ' , to take away my reproach among men . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth , <EOV> <SOV> to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary . <EOV> <SOV> And he came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favored , the Lord ' is ' with thee . <EOV> <SOV> But she was greatly troubled at the saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favor with God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name JESUS . <EOV> <SOV> He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Most High : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David : <EOV> <SOV> and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ? <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee , and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee : wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , Elisabeth thy kinswoman , she also hath conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren . <EOV> <SOV> For no word from God shall be void of power . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , Behold , the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Judah ; <EOV> <SOV> and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry , and said , Blessed ' art ' thou among women , and blessed ' is ' the fruit of thy womb . <EOV> <SOV> And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come unto me ? <EOV> <SOV> For behold , when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed ' is ' she that believed ; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord , <EOV> <SOV> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour . <EOV> <SOV> For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid : For behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed . <EOV> <SOV> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; And holy is his name . <EOV> <SOV> And his mercy is unto generations and generations On them that fear him . <EOV> <SOV> He hath showed strength with his arm ; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart . <EOV> <SOV> He hath put down princes from ' their ' thrones , And hath exalted them of low degree . <EOV> <SOV> The hungry he hath filled with good things ; And the rich he hath sent empty away . <EOV> <SOV> He hath given help to Israel his servant , That he might remember mercy <EOV> <SOV> ( As he spake unto our fathers ) Toward Abraham and his seed for ever . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned unto her house . <EOV> <SOV> Now Elisabeth 's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son . <EOV> <SOV> And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her ; and they rejoiced with her . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on the eighth day , that they came to circumcise the child ; and they would have called him Zacharias , after the name of the father . <EOV> <SOV> And his mother answered and said , Not so ; but he shall be called John . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name . <EOV> <SOV> And they made signs to his father , what he would have him called . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , saying , His name is John . And they marvelled all . <EOV> <SOV> And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue ' loosed ' , and he spake , blessing God . <EOV> <SOV> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea . <EOV> <SOV> And all that heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , What then shall this child be ? For the hand of the Lord was with him . <EOV> <SOV> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Blessed ' be ' the Lord , the God of Israel ; For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people , <EOV> <SOV> And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his servant David <EOV> <SOV> ( As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old ) , <EOV> <SOV> Salvation from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ; <EOV> <SOV> To show mercy towards , our fathers , And to remember his holy covenant ; <EOV> <SOV> The oath which he spake unto Abraham our father , <EOV> <SOV> To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies Should serve him without fear , <EOV> <SOV> In holiness and righteousness before him all our days . <EOV> <SOV> Yea and thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Most High : For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways ; <EOV> <SOV> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people In the remission of their sins , <EOV> <SOV> Because of the tender mercy of our God , Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us , <EOV> <SOV> To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death ; To guide our feet into the way of peace . <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now it came to pass in those days , there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus , that all the world should be enrolled . <EOV> <SOV> This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria . <EOV> <SOV> And all went to enrol themselves , every one to his own city . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ; <EOV> <SOV> to enrol himself with Mary , who was betrothed to him , being great with child . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while they were there , the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered . <EOV> <SOV> And she brought forth her firstborn son ; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn . <EOV> <SOV> And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field , and keeping watch by night over their flock . <EOV> <SOV> And an angel of the Lord stood by them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said unto them , Be not afraid ; for behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people : <EOV> <SOV> for there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour , who is Christ the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And this ' is ' the sign unto you : Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , and lying in a manger . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Glory to God in the highest , And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the angels went away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing that is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us . <EOV> <SOV> And they came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw it , they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child . <EOV> <SOV> And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary kept all these sayings , pondering them in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , even as it was spoken unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him , his name was called JESUS , which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb . <EOV> <SOV> And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord <EOV> <SOV> ( as it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ) , <EOV> <SOV> and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon ; and this man was righteous and devout , looking for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Spirit was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he came in the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law , <EOV> <SOV> then he received him into his arms , and blessed God , and said , <EOV> <SOV> Now lettest thou thy servant depart , Lord , According to thy word , in peace ; <EOV> <SOV> For mine eyes have seen thy salvation , <EOV> <SOV> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples ; <EOV> <SOV> A light for revelation to the Gentiles , And the glory of thy people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him ; <EOV> <SOV> and Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this ' child ' is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel ; and for a sign which is spoken against ; <EOV> <SOV> yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul ; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed . <EOV> <SOV> And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher ( she was of a great age , having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity , <EOV> <SOV> and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years ) , who departed not from the temple , worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day . <EOV> <SOV> And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto God , and spake of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew , and waxed strong , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was twelve years old , they went up after the custom of the feast ; <EOV> <SOV> and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and his parents knew it not ; <EOV> <SOV> but supposing him to be in the company , they went a day 's journey ; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance : <EOV> <SOV> and when they found him not , they returned to Jerusalem , seeking for him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both hearing them , and asking them questions : <EOV> <SOV> and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him , they were astonished ; and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I sought thee sorrowing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? knew ye not that I must be in my Father 's house ? <EOV> <SOV> And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth ; and he was subject unto them : and his mother kept all ' these ' sayings in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and men . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene , <EOV> <SOV> in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness . <EOV> <SOV> And he came into all the region round about the Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins ; <EOV> <SOV> as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make ye ready the way of the Lord , Make his paths straight . <EOV> <SOV> Every valley shall be filled , And every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; And the crooked shall become straight , And the rough ways smooth ; <EOV> <SOV> And all flesh shall see the salvation of God . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be baptized of him , Ye offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? <EOV> <SOV> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees : every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes asked him , saying , What then must we do ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath food , let him do likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And there came also publicans to be baptized , and they said unto him , Teacher , what must we do ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Extort no more than that which is appointed you . <EOV> <SOV> And soldiers also asked him , saying , And we , what must we do ? And he said unto them , Extort from no man by violence , neither accuse ' any one ' wrongfully ; and be content with your wages . <EOV> <SOV> And as the people were in expectation , and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John , whether haply he were the Christ ; <EOV> <SOV> John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but there cometh he that is mightier than I , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and ' in ' fire : <EOV> <SOV> whose fan is in his hand , thoroughly to cleanse his threshing - floor , and to gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire . <EOV> <SOV> With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people ; <EOV> <SOV> but Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother 's wife , and for all the evil things which Herod had done , <EOV> <SOV> added this also to them all , that he shut up John in prison . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came to pass , when all the people were baptized , that , Jesus also having been baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened , <EOV> <SOV> and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form , as a dove , upon him , and a voice came out of heaven , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus himself , when he began ' to teach ' , was about thirty years of age , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the ' son ' of Heli , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Matthat , the ' son ' of Levi , the ' son ' of Melchi , the ' son ' of Jannai , the ' son ' of Joseph , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Mattathias , the ' son ' of Amos , the ' son ' of Nahum , the ' son ' of Esli , the ' son ' of Naggai , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Maath , the ' son ' of Mattathias , the ' son ' of Semein , the ' son ' of Josech , the ' son ' of Joda , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Joanan , the ' son ' of Rhesa , the ' son ' of Zerubbabel , the ' son ' of Shealtiel , the ' son ' of Neri , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Melchi , the ' son ' of Addi , the ' son ' of Cosam , the ' son ' of Elmadam , the ' son ' of Er , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Jesus , the ' son ' of Eliezer , the son of Jorim , the ' son ' of Matthat , the ' son ' of Levi , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Symeon , the ' son ' of Judas , the ' son ' of Joseph , the ' son ' of Jonam , the ' son ' of Eliakim , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Melea , the ' son ' of Menna , the ' son ' of Mattatha , the ' son ' of Nathan , the ' son ' of David , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Jesse , the ' son ' of Obed , the ' son ' of Boaz , the ' son ' of Salmon , the ' son ' of Nahshon , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Amminadab , the ' son ' of Arni , the ' son ' of Hezron , the ' son ' of Perez , the ' son ' of Judah , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Jacob , the ' son ' of Isaac , the ' son ' of Abraham , the ' son ' of Terah , the ' son ' of Nahor , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Serug , the ' son ' of Reu , the ' son ' of Peleg , the ' son ' of Eber , the ' son ' of Shelah , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Cainan , the ' son ' of Arphaxad , the ' son ' of Shem , the ' son ' of Noah , the ' son ' of Lamech , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Methuselah , the ' son ' of Enoch , the ' son ' of Jared , the ' son ' of Mahalaleel , the ' son ' of Cainan , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Enos , the ' son ' of Seth , the ' son ' of Adam , the ' son ' of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan , and was led in the Spirit in the wilderness <EOV> <SOV> during forty days , being tempted of the devil . And he did eat nothing in those days : and when they were completed , he hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said unto him , if thou art the Son of God , command this stone that it become bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered unto him , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone . <EOV> <SOV> And he led him up , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said unto him , To thee will I give all this authority , and the glory of them : for it hath been delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it . <EOV> <SOV> If thou therefore wilt worship before me , it shall all be thine . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto him , It is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve . <EOV> <SOV> And he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou art the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence : <EOV> <SOV> for it is written , He shall give his angels charge concerning thee , to guard thee : <EOV> <SOV> and , On their hands they shall bear thee up , Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God . <EOV> <SOV> And when the devil had completed every temptation , he departed from him for a season . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and a fame went out concerning him through all the region round about . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and he entered , as his custom was , into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up to read . <EOV> <SOV> And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah . And he opened the book , and found the place where it was written , <EOV> <SOV> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , Because he anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor : He hath sent me to proclaim release to the captives , And recovering of sight to the blind , To set at liberty them that are bruised , <EOV> <SOV> To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he closed the book , and gave it back to the attendant , and sat down : and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fastened on him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to say unto them , To - day hath this scripture been fulfilled in your ears . <EOV> <SOV> And all bare him witness , and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth : and they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Doubtless ye will say unto me this parable , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done at Capernaum , do also here in thine own country . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Verily I say unto you , No prophet is acceptable in his own country . <EOV> <SOV> But of a truth I say unto you , There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when there came a great famine over all the land ; <EOV> <SOV> and unto none of them was Elijah sent , but only to Zarephath , in the land of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow . <EOV> <SOV> And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , but only Naaman the Syrian . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all filled with wrath in the synagogue , as they heard these things ; <EOV> <SOV> and they rose up , and cast him forth out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might throw him down headlong . <EOV> <SOV> But he passing through the midst of them went his way . <EOV> <SOV> And he came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee . And he was teaching them on the sabbath day : <EOV> <SOV> and they were astonished at his teaching ; for his word was with authority . <EOV> <SOV> And in the synagogue there was a man , that had a spirit of an unclean demon ; and he cried out with a loud voice , <EOV> <SOV> Ah ! what have we to do with thee , Jesus thou Nazarene ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst , he came out of him , having done him no hurt . <EOV> <SOV> And amazement came upon all , and they spake together , one with another , saying , What is this word ? for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out . <EOV> <SOV> And there went forth a rumor concerning him into every place of the region round about . <EOV> <SOV> And he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into the house of Simon . And Simon 's wife 's mother was holden with a great fever ; and they besought him for her . <EOV> <SOV> And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she rose up and ministered unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And demons also came out from many , crying out , and saying , Thou art the Son of God . And rebuking them , he suffered them not to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , he came out and went into a desert place : and the multitudes sought after him , and came unto him , and would have stayed him , that he should not go from them . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto them , I must preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also : for therefore was I sent . <EOV> <SOV> And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now it came to pass , while the multitude pressed upon him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret ; <EOV> <SOV> and he saw two boats standing by the lake : but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets . <EOV> <SOV> And he entered into one of the boats , which was Simon 's , and asked him to put out a little from the land . And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Put out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon answered and said , Master , we toiled all night , and took nothing : but at thy word I will let down the nets . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had done this , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes ; and their nets were breaking ; <EOV> <SOV> and they beckoned unto their partners in the other boat , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink . <EOV> <SOV> But Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord . <EOV> <SOV> For he was amazed , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken ; <EOV> <SOV> and so were also James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had brought their boats to land , they left all , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while he was in one of the cities , behold , a man full of leprosy : and when he saw Jesus , he fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou made clean . And straightway the leprosy departed from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged him to tell no man : but go thy way , and show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them . <EOV> <SOV> But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed of their infirmities . <EOV> <SOV> But he withdrew himself in the deserts , and prayed . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on one of those days , that he was teaching ; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was with him to heal . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , men bring on a bed a man that was palsied : and they sought to bring him in , and to lay him before him . <EOV> <SOV> And not finding by what ' way ' they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the housetop , and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the midst before Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing their faith , he said , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this that speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus perceiving their reasonings , answered and said unto them , Why reason ye in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( he said unto him that was palsied ) , I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go unto thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his house , glorifying God . <EOV> <SOV> And amazement took hold on all , and they glorified God ; and they were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to - day . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he went forth , and beheld a publican , named Levi , sitting at the place of toll , and said unto him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And he forsook all , and rose up and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Levi made him a great feast in his house : and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others that were sitting at meat with them . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with the publicans and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are in health have no need of a physician ; but they that are sick . <EOV> <SOV> I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , The disciples of John fast often , and make supplications ; likewise also the ' disciples ' of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Can ye make the sons of the bride - chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? <EOV> <SOV> But the days will come ; and when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , then will they fast in those days . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake also a parable unto them : No man rendeth a piece from a new garment and putteth it upon an old garment ; else he will rend the new , and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old . <EOV> <SOV> And no man putteth new wine into old wine - skins ; else the new wine will burst the skins , and itself will be spilled , and the skins will perish . <EOV> <SOV> But new wine must be put into fresh wine - skins . <EOV> <SOV> And no man having drunk old ' wine ' desireth new ; for he saith , The old is good . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now it came to pass on a sabbath , that he was going through the grainfields ; and his disciples plucked the ears , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands . <EOV> <SOV> But certain of the Pharisees said , Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read even this , what David did , when he was hungry , he , and they that were with him ; <EOV> <SOV> how he entered into the house of God , and took and ate the showbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , The Son of man is lord of the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man there , and his right hand was withered . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath ; that they might find how to accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> But he knew their thoughts ; and he said to the man that had his hand withered , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose and stood forth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , I ask you , Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to destroy it ? <EOV> <SOV> And he looked round about on them all , and said unto him , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did ' so ' : and his hand was restored . <EOV> <SOV> But they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in these days , that he went out into the mountain to pray ; and he continued all night in prayer to God . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , he called his disciples ; and he chose from them twelve , whom also he named apostles : <EOV> <SOV> Simon , whom he also named Peter , and Andrew his brother , and James and John , and Philip and Bartholomew , <EOV> <SOV> and Matthew and Thomas , and James ' the son ' of Alphaeus , and Simon who was called the Zealot , <EOV> <SOV> and Judas ' the son ' of James , and Judas Iscariot , who became a traitor ; <EOV> <SOV> and he came down with them , and stood on a level place , and a great multitude of his disciples , and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem , and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ; <EOV> <SOV> and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed . <EOV> <SOV> And all the multitude sought to touch him ; for power came forth from him , and healed ' them ' all . <EOV> <SOV> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed ' are ' ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed ' are ' ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed ' are ' ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you ' from their company ' , and reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> Rejoice in that day , and leap ' for joy ' : for behold , your reward is great in heaven ; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , ye that are full now ! for ye shall hunger . Woe ' unto you ' , ye that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep . <EOV> <SOV> Woe ' unto you ' , when all men shall speak well of you ! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you that hear , Love your enemies , do good to them that hate you , <EOV> <SOV> bless them that curse you , pray for them that despitefully use you . <EOV> <SOV> To him that smiteth thee on the ' one ' cheek offer also the other ; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also . <EOV> <SOV> Give to every one that asketh thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye love them that love you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners love those that love them . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye do good to them that do good to you , what thank have ye ? for even sinners do the same . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? even sinners lend to sinners , to receive again as much . <EOV> <SOV> But love your enemies , and do ' them ' good , and lend , never despairing ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be sons of the Most High : for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil . <EOV> <SOV> Be ye merciful , even as your Father is merciful . <EOV> <SOV> And judge not , and ye shall not be judged : and condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : release , and ye shall be released : <EOV> <SOV> give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , shaken together , running over , shall they give into your bosom . For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake also a parable unto them , Can the blind guide the blind ? shall they not both fall into a pit ? <EOV> <SOV> The disciple is not above his teacher : but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher . <EOV> <SOV> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Or how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit ; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit . <EOV> <SOV> For each tree is known by its own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes . <EOV> <SOV> The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and the evil ' man ' out of the evil ' treasure ' bringeth forth that which is evil : for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? <EOV> <SOV> Every one that cometh unto me , and heareth my words , and doeth them , I will show you to whom he is like : <EOV> <SOV> he is like a man building a house , who digged and went deep , and laid a foundation upon the rock : and when a flood arose , the stream brake against that house , and could not shake it : because it had been well builded . <EOV> <SOV> But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation ; against which the stream brake , and straightway it fell in ; and the ruin of that house was great . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people , he entered into Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick and at the point of death . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard concerning Jesus , he sent unto him elders of the Jews , asking him that he would come and save his servant . <EOV> <SOV> And they , when they came to Jesus , besought him earnestly , saying , He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him ; <EOV> <SOV> for he loveth our nation , and himself built us our synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself ; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : <EOV> <SOV> wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say the word , and my servant shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> For I also am a man set under authority , having under myself soldiers : and I say to this one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass soon afterwards , that he went to a city called Nain ; and his disciples went with him , and a great multitude . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , there was carried out one that was dead , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not . <EOV> <SOV> And he came nigh and touched the bier : and the bearers stood still . And he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he gave him to his mother . <EOV> <SOV> And fear took hold on all : and they glorified God , saying , A great prophet is arisen among us : and , God hath visited his people . <EOV> <SOV> And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea , and all the region round about . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John told him of all these things . <EOV> <SOV> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to the Lord , saying , Art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ? <EOV> <SOV> And when the men were come unto him , they said , John the Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ? <EOV> <SOV> In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits ; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard ; the blind receive their sight , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , the poor have good tidings preached to them . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me . <EOV> <SOV> And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to behold ? a reed shaken with the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they that are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts . <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> This is he of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way before thee . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John : yet he that is but little in the kingdom of God is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people when they heard , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God , being not baptized of him . <EOV> <SOV> Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation , and to what are they like ? <EOV> <SOV> They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace , and call one to another ; who say , We piped unto you , and ye did not dance ; we wailed , and ye did not weep . <EOV> <SOV> For John the Baptist is come eating no bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a demon . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold , a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners ! <EOV> <SOV> And wisdom is justified of all her children . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he entered into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a woman who was in the city , a sinner ; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee 's house , she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment , <EOV> <SOV> and standing behind at his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and wiped them with the hair of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him , that she is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he saith , Teacher , say on . <EOV> <SOV> A certain lender had two debtors : the one owed five hundred shillings , and the other fifty . <EOV> <SOV> When they had not ' wherewith ' to pay , he forgave them both . Which of them therefore will love him most ? <EOV> <SOV> Simon answered and said , He , I suppose , to whom he forgave the most . And he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged . <EOV> <SOV> And turning to the woman , he said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath wetted my feet with her tears , and wiped them with her hair . <EOV> <SOV> Thou gavest me no kiss : but she , since the time I came in , hath not ceased to kiss my feet . <EOV> <SOV> My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but she hath anointed my feet with ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , ' the same ' loveth little . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that even forgiveth sins ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass soon afterwards , that he went about through cities and villages , preaching and bringing the good tidings of the kingdom of God , and with him the twelve , <EOV> <SOV> and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities : Mary that was called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out , <EOV> <SOV> and Joanna the wife of Chuzas Herod 's steward , and Susanna , and many others , who ministered unto them of their substance . <EOV> <SOV> And when a great multitude came together , and they of every city resorted unto him , he spake by a parable : <EOV> <SOV> The sower went forth to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden under foot , and the birds of the heaven devoured it . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell on the rock ; and as soon as it grew , it withered away , because it had no moisture . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell amidst the thorns ; and the thorns grew with it , and choked it . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell into the good ground , and grew , and brought forth fruit a hundredfold . As he said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him what this parable might be . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to the rest in parables ; that seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . <EOV> <SOV> Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God . <EOV> <SOV> And those by the way side are they that have heard ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word from their heart , that they may not believe and be saved . <EOV> <SOV> And those on the rock ' are ' they who , when they have heard , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , who for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away . <EOV> <SOV> And that which fell among the thorns , these are they that have heard , and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of ' this ' life , and bring no fruit to perfection . <EOV> <SOV> And that in the good ground , these are such as in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , hold it fast , and bring forth fruit with patience . <EOV> <SOV> And no man , when he hath lighted a lamp , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but putteth it on a stand , that they that enter in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> For nothing is hid , that shall not be made manifest ; nor ' anything ' secret , that shall not be known and come to light . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he thinketh he hath . <EOV> <SOV> And there came to him his mother and brethren , and they could not come at him for the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> And it was told him , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these that hear the word of God , and do it . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came to pass on one of those days , that he entered into a boat , himself and his disciples ; and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake : and they launched forth . <EOV> <SOV> But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filling ' with water ' , and were in jeopardy . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . And he awoke , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Where is your faith ? And being afraid they marvelled , saying one to another , Who then is this , that he commandeth even the winds and the water , and they obey him ? <EOV> <SOV> And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes , which is over against Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come forth upon the land , there met him a certain man out of the city , who had demons ; and for a long time he had worn no clothes , and abode not in ' any ' house , but in the tombs . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the Most High God ? I beseech thee , torment me not . <EOV> <SOV> For he was commanding the unclean spirit to come out from the man . For oftentimes it had seized him : and he was kept under guard , and bound with chains and fetters ; and breaking the bands asunder , he was driven of the demon into the deserts . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus asked him , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion ; for many demons were entered into him . <EOV> <SOV> And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them . And he gave them leave . <EOV> <SOV> And the demons came out from the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake , and were drowned . <EOV> <SOV> And when they that fed them saw what had come to pass , they fled , and told it in the city and in the country . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out to see what had come to pass ; and they came to Jesus , and found the man , from whom the demons were gone out , sitting , clothed and in his right mind , at the feet of Jesus : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And they that saw it told them how he that was possessed with demons was made whole . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes round about asked him to depart from them , for they were holden with great fear : and he entered into a boat , and returned . <EOV> <SOV> But the man from whom the demons were gone out prayed him that he might be with him : but he sent him away , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Return to thy house , and declare how great things God hath done for thee . And he went his way , publishing throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done for him . <EOV> <SOV> And as Jesus returned , the multitude welcomed him ; for they were all waiting for him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him to come into his house ; <EOV> <SOV> for he had an only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she was dying . But as he went the multitudes thronged him . <EOV> <SOV> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , who had spent all her living upon physicians , and could not be healed of any , <EOV> <SOV> came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately the issue of her blood stanched . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Who is it that touched me ? And when all denied , Peter said , and they that were with him , Master , the multitudes press thee and crush ' thee ' . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Some one did touch me ; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me . <EOV> <SOV> And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him , and how she was healed immediately . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace . <EOV> <SOV> While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's ' house ' , saying , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Teacher . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus hearing it , answered him , Fear not : only believe , and she shall be made whole . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to the house , he suffered not any man to enter in with him , save Peter , and John , and James , and the father of the maiden and her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And all were weeping , and bewailing her : but he said , Weep not ; for she is not dead , but sleepeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead . <EOV> <SOV> But he , taking her by the hand , called , saying , Maiden , arise . <EOV> <SOV> And her spirit returned , and she rose up immediately : and he commanded that ' something ' be given her to eat . <EOV> <SOV> And her parents were amazed : but he charged them to tell no man what had been done . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he called the twelve together , and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staff , nor wallet , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever house ye enter , there abide , and thence depart . <EOV> <SOV> And as many as receive you not , when ye depart from that city , shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed , and went throughout the villages , preaching the gospel , and healing everywhere . <EOV> <SOV> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done : and he was much perplexed , because that it was said by some , that John was risen from the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> and by some , that Elijah had appeared ; and by others , that one of the old prophets was risen again . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod said , John I beheaded : but who is this , about whom I hear such things ? And he sought to see him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles , when they were returned , declared unto him what things they had done . And he took them , and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida . <EOV> <SOV> But the multitudes perceiving it followed him : and he welcomed them , and spake to them of the kingdom of God , and them that had need of healing he cured . <EOV> <SOV> And the day began to wear away ; and the twelve came , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages and country round about , and lodge , and get provisions : for we are here in a desert place . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more than five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy food for all this people . <EOV> <SOV> For they were about five thousand men . And he said unto his disciples , Make them sit down in companies , about fifty each . <EOV> <SOV> And they did so , and made them all sit down . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake ; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they ate , and were all filled : and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces , twelve baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he was praying apart , the disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Who do the multitudes say that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And they answering said , John the Baptist ; but others ' say ' , Elijah ; and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , But who say ye that I am ? And Peter answering said , The Christ of God . <EOV> <SOV> But he charged them , and commanded ' them ' to tell this to no man ; <EOV> <SOV> saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto all , If any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it . <EOV> <SOV> For what is a man profited , if he gain the whole world , and lose or forfeit his own self ? <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in his own glory , and ' the glory ' of the Father , and of the holy angels . <EOV> <SOV> But I tell you of a truth , There are some of them that stand here , who shall in no wise taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings , that he took with him Peter and John and James , and went up into the mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was praying , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment ' became ' white ' and ' dazzling . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there talked with him two men , who were Moses and Elijah ; <EOV> <SOV> who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as they were parting from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah : not knowing what he said . <EOV> <SOV> And while he said these things , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud . <EOV> <SOV> And a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my Son , my chosen : hear ye him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the voice came , Jesus was found alone . And they held their peace , and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , on the next day , when they were come down from the mountain , a great multitude met him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a man from the multitude cried , saying , Teacher , I beseech thee to look upon my son ; for he is mine only child : <EOV> <SOV> and behold , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth , and it hardly departeth from him , bruising him sorely . <EOV> <SOV> And I besought thy disciples to cast it out ; and they could not . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and bear with you ? bring hither thy son . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was yet a coming , the demon dashed him down , and tare ' him ' grievously . But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all astonished at the majesty of God . But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did , he said unto his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Let these words sink into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men . <EOV> <SOV> But they understood not this saying , and it was concealed from them , that they should not perceive it ; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying . <EOV> <SOV> And there arose a reasoning among them , which of them was the greatest . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart , he took a little child , and set him by his side , <EOV> <SOV> and said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same is great . <EOV> <SOV> And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followeth not with us . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said unto him , Forbid ' him ' not : for he that is not against you is for you . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the days were well - nigh come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> and sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him . <EOV> <SOV> And they did not receive him , because his face was ' as though he were ' going to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples James and John saw ' this ' , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven , and consume them ? <EOV> <SOV> But he turned , and rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> And they went to another village . <EOV> <SOV> And as they went on the way , a certain man said unto him , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven ' have ' nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto him , Leave the dead to bury their own dead ; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And another also said , I will follow thee , Lord ; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself was about to come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , The harvest indeed is plenteous , but the laborers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he send forth laborers into his harvest . <EOV> <SOV> Go your ways ; behold , I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves . <EOV> <SOV> Carry no purse , no wallet , no shoes ; and salute no man on the way . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever house ye shall enter , first say , Peace ' be ' to this house . <EOV> <SOV> And if a son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon him : but if not , it shall turn to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And in that same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the laborer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you : <EOV> <SOV> and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But into whatsoever city ye shall enter , and they receive you not , go out into the streets thereof and say , <EOV> <SOV> Even the dust from your city , that cleaveth to our feet , we wipe off against you : nevertheless know this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which were done in you , they would have repented long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes . <EOV> <SOV> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment , than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , Capernaum , shalt thou be exalted unto heaven ? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades . <EOV> <SOV> He that heareth you heareth me ; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me ; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the seventy returned with joy , saying , Lord , even the demons are subject unto us in thy name . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall in any wise hurt you . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding , and didst reveal them unto babes : yea , Father ; for so it was well - pleasing in thy sight . <EOV> <SOV> All things have been delivered unto me of my Father : and no one knoweth who the Son is , save the Father ; and who the Father is , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal ' him ' . <EOV> <SOV> And turning to the disciples , he said privately , Blessed ' are ' the eyes which see the things that ye see : <EOV> <SOV> for I say unto you , that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see , and saw them not ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and heard them not . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him , saying , Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbor as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live . <EOV> <SOV> But he , desiring to justify himself , said unto Jesus , And who is my neighbor ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus made answer and said , A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho ; and he fell among robbers , who both stripped him and beat him , and departed , leaving him half dead . <EOV> <SOV> And by chance a certain priest was going down that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And in like manner a Levite also , when he came to the place , and saw him , passed by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he was moved with compassion , <EOV> <SOV> and came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on ' them ' oil and wine ; and he set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow he took out two shillings , and gave them to the host , and said , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , I , when I come back again , will repay thee . <EOV> <SOV> Which of these three , thinkest thou , proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , He that showed mercy on him . And Jesus said unto him , Go , and do thou likewise . <EOV> <SOV> Now as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house . <EOV> <SOV> And she had a sister called Mary , who also sat at the Lord 's feet , and heard his word . <EOV> <SOV> But Martha was cumbered about much serving ; and she came up to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me . <EOV> <SOV> But the Lord answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art anxious and troubled about many things : <EOV> <SOV> but one thing is needful : for Mary hath chosen the good part , which shall not be taken away from her . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he was praying in a certain place , that when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , even as John also taught his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Father , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . <EOV> <SOV> Give us day by day our daily bread . <EOV> <SOV> And forgive us our sins ; for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And bring us not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say to him , Friend , lend me three loaves ; <EOV> <SOV> for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey , and I have nothing to set before him ; <EOV> <SOV> and he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee ? <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> And of which of you that is a father shall his son ask a loaf , and he give him a stone ? or a fish , and he for a fish give him a serpent ? <EOV> <SOV> Or ' if ' he shall ask an egg , will he give him a scorpion ? <EOV> <SOV> If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall ' your ' heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he was casting out a demon ' that was ' dumb . And it came to pass , when the demon was gone out , the dumb man spake ; and the multitudes marvelled . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them said , By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casteth he out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And others , trying ' him ' , sought of him a sign from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house ' divided ' against a house falleth . <EOV> <SOV> And if Satan also is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub . <EOV> <SOV> And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if I by the finger of God cast out demons , then is the kingdom of God come upon you . <EOV> <SOV> When the strong ' man ' fully armed guardeth his own court , his goods are in peace : <EOV> <SOV> but when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him his whole armor wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils . <EOV> <SOV> He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth . <EOV> <SOV> The unclean spirit when he is gone out of the man , passeth through waterless places , seeking rest , and finding none , he saith , I will turn back unto my house whence I came out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he is come , he findeth it swept and garnished . <EOV> <SOV> Then goeth he , and taketh ' to him ' seven other spirits more evil than himself ; and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he said these things , a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the breasts which thou didst suck . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it . <EOV> <SOV> And when the multitudes were gathering together unto him , he began to say , This generation is an evil generation : it seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah . <EOV> <SOV> For even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , a greater than Solomon is here . <EOV> <SOV> The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , a greater than Jonah is here . <EOV> <SOV> No man , when he hath lighted a lamp , putteth it in a cellar , neither under the bushel , but on the stand , that they which enter in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> The lamp of thy body is thine eye : when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when it is evil , thy body also is full of darkness . <EOV> <SOV> Look therefore whether the light that is in thee be not darkness . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore thy whole body be full of light , having no part dark , it shall be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining doth give thee light . <EOV> <SOV> Now as he spake , a Pharisee asketh him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said unto him , Now ye the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter ; but your inward part is full of extortion and wickedness . <EOV> <SOV> Ye foolish ones , did not he that made the outside make the inside also ? <EOV> <SOV> But give for alms those things which are within ; and behold , all things are clean unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto you Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and every herb , and pass over justice and the love of God : but these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you Pharisees ! for ye love the chief seats in the synagogues , and the salutations in the marketplaces . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you ! for ye are as the tombs which appear not , and the men that walk over ' them ' know it not . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the lawyers answering saith unto him , Teacher , in saying this thou reproachest us also . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Woe unto you lawyers also ! for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you ! for ye build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them . <EOV> <SOV> So ye are witnesses and consent unto the works of your fathers : for they killed them , and ye build ' their tombs ' . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send unto them prophets and apostles ; and ' some ' of them they shall kill and persecute ; <EOV> <SOV> that the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ; <EOV> <SOV> from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah , who perished between the altar and the sanctuary : yea , I say unto you , it shall be required of this generation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you lawyers ! for ye took away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come out from thence , the scribes and the Pharisees began to press upon ' him ' vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things ; <EOV> <SOV> laying wait for him , to catch something out of his mouth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In the mean time , when the many thousands of the multitude were gathered together , insomuch that they trod one upon another , he began to say unto his disciples first of all , Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy . <EOV> <SOV> But there is nothing covered up , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light ; and what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do . <EOV> <SOV> But I will warn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , who after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him . <EOV> <SOV> Are not five sparrows sold for two pence ? and not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God . <EOV> <SOV> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not : ye are of more value than many sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , Every one who shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God : <EOV> <SOV> but he that denieth me in the presence of men shall be denied in the presence of the angels of God . <EOV> <SOV> And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And when they bring you before the synagogues , and the rulers , and the authorities , be not anxious how or what ye shall answer , or what ye shall say : <EOV> <SOV> for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that very hour what ye ought to say . <EOV> <SOV> And one out of the multitude said unto him , Teacher , bid my brother divide the inheritance with me . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto him , Man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Take heed , and keep yourselves from all covetousness : for a man 's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully : <EOV> <SOV> and he reasoned within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have not where to bestow my fruits ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my grain and my goods . <EOV> <SOV> And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , be merry . <EOV> <SOV> But God said unto him , Thou foolish one , this night is thy soul required of thee ; and the things which thou hast prepared , whose shall they be ? <EOV> <SOV> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Be not anxious for ' your ' life , what ye shall eat ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . <EOV> <SOV> For the life is more than the food , and the body than the raiment . <EOV> <SOV> Consider the ravens , that they sow not , neither reap ; which have no store - chamber nor barn ; and God feedeth them : of how much more value are ye than the birds ! <EOV> <SOV> And which of you by being anxious can add a cubit unto the measure of his life ? <EOV> <SOV> If then ye are not able to do even that which is least , why are ye anxious concerning the rest ? <EOV> <SOV> Consider the lilies , how they grow : they toil not , neither do they spin ; yet I say unto you , Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . <EOV> <SOV> But if God doth so clothe the grass in the field , which to - day is , and to - morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more ' shall he clothe ' you , O ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And seek not ye what ye shall eat , and what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind . <EOV> <SOV> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : but your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things . <EOV> <SOV> Yet seek ye his kingdom , and these things shall be added unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> Sell that which ye have , and give alms ; make for yourselves purses which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief draweth near , neither moth destroyeth . <EOV> <SOV> For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . <EOV> <SOV> Let your loins be girded about , and your lamps burning ; <EOV> <SOV> and be ye yourselves like unto men looking for their lord , when he shall return from the marriage feast ; that , when he cometh and knocketh , they may straightway open unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them sit down to meat , and shall come and serve them . <EOV> <SOV> And if he shall come in the second watch , and if in the third , and find ' them ' so blessed are those ' servants ' . <EOV> <SOV> But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not have left his house to be broken through . <EOV> <SOV> Be ye also ready : for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even unto all ? <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Who then is the faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall set over his household , to give them their portion of food in due season ? <EOV> <SOV> Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing . <EOV> <SOV> Of a truth I say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath . <EOV> <SOV> But if that servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ; <EOV> <SOV> the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not , and in an hour when he knoweth not , and shall cut him asunder , and appoint his portion with the unfaithful . <EOV> <SOV> And that servant , who knew his lord 's will , and made not ready , nor did according to his will , shall be beaten with many ' stripes ' ; <EOV> <SOV> but he that knew not , and did things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few ' stripes ' . And to whomsoever much is given , of him shall much be required : and to whom they commit much , of him will they ask the more . <EOV> <SOV> I came to cast fire upon the earth ; and what do I desire , if it is already kindled ? <EOV> <SOV> But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished ! <EOV> <SOV> Think ye that I am come to give peace in the earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division : <EOV> <SOV> for there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three . <EOV> <SOV> They shall be divided , father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against her mother ; mother in law against her daughter in law , and daughter in law against her mother in law . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the multitudes also , When ye see a cloud rising in the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it cometh to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And when ' ye see ' a south wind blowing , ye say , There will be a scorching heat ; and it cometh to pass . <EOV> <SOV> Ye hypocrites , ye know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven ; but how is it that ye know not how to interpret this time ? <EOV> <SOV> And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ? <EOV> <SOV> For as thou art going with thine adversary before the magistrate , on the way give diligence to be quit of him ; lest haply he drag thee unto the judge , and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer , and the officer shall cast thee into prison . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the very last mite . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now there were some present at that very season who told him of the Galilaeans , whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , Think ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans , because they have suffered these things ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all in like manner perish . <EOV> <SOV> Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them , think ye that they were offenders above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake this parable ; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came seeking fruit thereon , and found none . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto the vinedresser , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why doth it also cumber the ground ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering saith unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it : <EOV> <SOV> and if it bear fruit thenceforth , ' well ' ; but if not , thou shalt cut it down . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath day . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years ; and she was bowed together , and could in no wise lift herself up . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity . <EOV> <SOV> And he laid his hands upon her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God . <EOV> <SOV> And the ruler of the synagogue , being moved with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath , answered and said to the multitude , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the day of the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But the Lord answered him , and said , Ye hypocrites , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ? <EOV> <SOV> And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan had bound , lo , ' these ' eighteen years , to have been loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And as he said these things , all his adversaries were put to shame : and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I liken it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like unto a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his own garden ; and it grew , and became a tree ; and the birds of the heaven lodged in the branches thereof . <EOV> <SOV> And again he said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like unto leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till it was all leavened . <EOV> <SOV> And he went on his way through cities and villages , teaching , and journeying on unto Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And one said unto him , Lord , are they few that are saved ? And he said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> Strive to enter in by the narrow door : for many , I say unto you , shall seek to enter in , and shall not be able . <EOV> <SOV> When once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , open to us ; and he shall answer and say to you , I know you not whence ye are ; <EOV> <SOV> then shall ye begin to say , We did eat and drink in thy presence , and thou didst teach in our streets ; <EOV> <SOV> and he shall say , I tell you , I know not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and yourselves cast forth without . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall come from the east and west , and from the north and south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last . <EOV> <SOV> In that very hour there came certain Pharisees , saying to him , Get thee out , and go hence : for Herod would fain kill thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Go and say to that fox , Behold , I cast out demons and perform cures to - day and to - morrow , and the third ' day ' I am perfected . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless I must go on my way to - day and to - morrow and the ' day ' following : for it can not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that killeth the prophets , and stoneth them that are sent unto her ! how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen ' gathereth ' her own brood under her wings , and ye would not ! <EOV> <SOV> Behold , your house is left unto you ' desolate ' : and I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a sabbath to eat bread , that they were watching him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was before him a certain man that had the dropsy . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a well , and will not straightway draw him up on a sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> And they could not answer again unto these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a parable unto those that were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief seats ; saying unto them , <EOV> <SOV> When thou art bidden of any man to a marriage feast , sit not down in the chief seat ; lest haply a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him , <EOV> <SOV> and he that bade thee and him shall come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take the lowest place . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest place ; that when he that hath bidden thee cometh , he may say to thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have glory in the presence of all that sit at meat with thee . <EOV> <SOV> For everyone that exalteth himself shall be humbled ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him also that had bidden him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , nor thy kinsmen , nor rich neighbors ; lest haply they also bid thee again , and a recompense be made thee . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou makest a feast , bid the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind : <EOV> <SOV> and thou shalt be blessed ; because they have not ' wherewith ' to recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed in the resurrection of the just . <EOV> <SOV> And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto him , A certain man made a great supper ; and he bade many : <EOV> <SOV> and he sent forth his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for ' all ' things are now ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they all with one ' consent ' began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a field , and I must needs go out and see it ; I pray thee have me excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them ; I pray thee have me excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant came , and told his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor and maimed and blind and lame . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant said , Lord , what thou didst command is done , and yet there is room . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and constrain ' them ' to come in , that my house may be filled . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that none of those men that were bidden shall taste of my supper . <EOV> <SOV> Now there went with him great multitudes : and he turned , and said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> If any man cometh unto me , and hateth not his own father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever doth not bear his own cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> For which of you , desiring to build a tower , doth not first sit down and count the cost , whether he have ' wherewith ' to complete it ? <EOV> <SOV> Lest haply , when he hath laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , all that behold begin to mock him , <EOV> <SOV> saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish . <EOV> <SOV> Or what king , as he goeth to encounter another king in war , will not sit down first and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ? <EOV> <SOV> Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and asketh conditions of peace . <EOV> <SOV> So therefore whosoever he be of you that renounceth not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> Salt therefore is good : but if even the salt have lost its savor , wherewith shall it be seasoned ? <EOV> <SOV> It is fit neither for the land nor for the dunghill : ' men ' cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake unto them this parable , saying , <EOV> <SOV> What man of you , having a hundred sheep , and having lost one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing . <EOV> <SOV> And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and his neighbors , saying unto them , Rejoice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , ' more ' than over ninety and nine righteous persons , who need no repentance . <EOV> <SOV> Or what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a lamp , and sweep the house , and seek diligently until she find it ? <EOV> <SOV> And when she hath found it , she calleth together her friends and neighbors , saying , Rejoice with me , for I have found the piece which I had lost . <EOV> <SOV> Even so , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A certain man had two sons : <EOV> <SOV> and the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of ' thy ' substance that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his living . <EOV> <SOV> And not many days after , the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country ; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that country ; and he began to be in want . <EOV> <SOV> And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine . <EOV> <SOV> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him . <EOV> <SOV> But when he came to himself he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish here with hunger ! <EOV> <SOV> I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight : <EOV> <SOV> I am no more worthy to be called your son : make me as one of thy hired servants . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and came to his father . But while he was yet afar off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight : I am no more worthy to be called thy son . <EOV> <SOV> But the father said to his servants , Bring forth quickly the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet : <EOV> <SOV> and bring the fatted calf , ' and ' kill it , and let us eat , and make merry : <EOV> <SOV> for this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry . <EOV> <SOV> Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing . <EOV> <SOV> And he called to him one of the servants , and inquired what these things might be . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound . <EOV> <SOV> But he was angry , and would not go in : and his father came out , and entreated him . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , and I never transgressed a commandment of thine ; and ' yet ' thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends : <EOV> <SOV> but when this thy son came , who hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou killedst for him the fatted calf . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that is mine is thine . <EOV> <SOV> But it was meet to make merry and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive ' again ' ; and ' was ' lost , and is found . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said also unto the disciples , There was a certain rich man , who had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods . <EOV> <SOV> And he called him , and said unto him , What is this that I hear of thee ? render the account of thy stewardship ; for thou canst be no longer steward . <EOV> <SOV> And the steward said within himself , What shall I do , seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me ? I have not strength to dig ; to beg I am ashamed . <EOV> <SOV> I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses . <EOV> <SOV> And calling to him each one of his lord 's debtors , he said to the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A hundred measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy bond , and sit down quickly and write fifty . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , A hundred measures of wheat . He saith unto him , Take thy bond , and write fourscore . <EOV> <SOV> And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely : for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when it shall fail , they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles . <EOV> <SOV> He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much : and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true ' riches ' ? <EOV> <SOV> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another 's , who will give you that which is your own ? <EOV> <SOV> No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees , who were lovers of money , heard all these things ; and they scoffed at him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God . <EOV> <SOV> The law and the prophets ' were ' until John : from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached , and every man entereth violently into it . <EOV> <SOV> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than for one tittle of the law to fall . <EOV> <SOV> Every one that putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was a certain rich man , and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , faring sumptuously every day : <EOV> <SOV> and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate , full of sores , <EOV> <SOV> and desiring to be fed with the ' crumbs ' that fell from the rich man 's table ; yea , even the dogs come and licked his sores . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham 's bosom : and the rich man also died , and was buried . <EOV> <SOV> And in Hades he lifted up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom . <EOV> <SOV> And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am in anguish in this flame . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and Lazarus in like manner evil things : but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish . <EOV> <SOV> And besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed , that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able , and that none may cross over from thence to us . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father 's house ; <EOV> <SOV> for I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham saith , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one go to them from the dead , they will repent . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , if one rise from the dead . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said unto his disciples , It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come ; but woe unto him , through whom they come ! <EOV> <SOV> It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed to yourselves : if thy brother sin , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And if he sin against thee seven times in the day , and seven times turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye would say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou rooted up , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it would obey you . <EOV> <SOV> But who is there of you , having a servant plowing or keeping sheep , that will say unto him , when he is come in from the field , Come straightway and sit down to meat ; <EOV> <SOV> and will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded ? <EOV> <SOV> Even so ye also , when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants ; we have done that which it was our duty to do . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as they were on their way to Jerusalem , that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , who stood afar off : <EOV> <SOV> and they lifted up their voices , saying , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go and show yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , as they went , they were cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , with a loud voice glorifying God ; <EOV> <SOV> and he fell upon his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , Were not the ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ? <EOV> <SOV> Were there none found that returned to give glory to God , save this stranger ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Arise , and go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole . <EOV> <SOV> And being asked by the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God cometh , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation : <EOV> <SOV> neither shall they say , Lo , here ! or , There ! for lo , the kingdom of God is within you . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall say to you , Lo , there ! Lo , here ! go not away , nor follow after ' them ' : <EOV> <SOV> for as the lightning , when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall the Son of man be in his day . <EOV> <SOV> But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And as it came to pass in the days of Noah , even so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> They ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot ; they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ; <EOV> <SOV> but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all : <EOV> <SOV> after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed . <EOV> <SOV> In that day , he that shall be on the housetop , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away : and let him that is in the field likewise not return back . <EOV> <SOV> Remember Lot 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it : but whosoever shall lose ' his life ' shall preserve it . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , In that night there shall be two men on one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left . <EOV> <SOV> There shall be two women grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left . <EOV> <SOV> ' There shall be two men in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they answering say unto him , Where , Lord ? And he said unto them , Where the body ' is ' , thither will the eagles also be gathered together . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray , and not to faint ; <EOV> <SOV> saying , There was in a city a judge , who feared not God , and regarded not man : <EOV> <SOV> and there was a widow in that city ; and she came oft unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary . <EOV> <SOV> And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ; <EOV> <SOV> yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest she wear me out by her continual coming . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Hear what the unrighteous judge saith . <EOV> <SOV> And shall not God avenge his elect , that cry to him day and night , and ' yet ' he is longsuffering over them ? <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless , when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? <EOV> <SOV> And he spake also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and set all others at nought : <EOV> <SOV> Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as the rest of men , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican . <EOV> <SOV> I fast twice in the week ; I give tithes of all that I get . <EOV> <SOV> But the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote his breast , saying , God , be thou merciful to me a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , This man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled ; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> And they were bringing unto him also their babes , that he should touch them : but when the disciples saw it , they rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus called them unto him , saying , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for to such belongeth the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Teacher , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , ' even ' God . <EOV> <SOV> Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor thy father and mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , All these things have I observed from my youth up . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus heard it , he said unto him , One thing thou lackest yet : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> But when he heard these things , he became exceeding sorrowful ; for he was very rich . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus seeing him said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they that heard it said , Then who can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> But he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , Lo , we have left our own , and followed thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or wife , or brethren , or parents , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake , <EOV> <SOV> who shall not receive manifold more in this time , and in the world to come eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> And he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and shamefully treated , and spit upon : <EOV> <SOV> and they shall scourge and kill him : and the third day he shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And they understood none of these things ; and this saying was hid from them , and they perceived not the things that were said . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he drew nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging : <EOV> <SOV> and hearing a multitude going by , he inquired what this meant . <EOV> <SOV> And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by . <EOV> <SOV> And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And they that went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried out the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him , <EOV> <SOV> What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight ; thy faith hath made thee whole . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered and was passing through Jericho . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a man called by name Zacchaeus ; and he was a chief publican , and he was rich . <EOV> <SOV> And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the crowd , because he was little of stature . <EOV> <SOV> And he ran on before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to - day I must abide at thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , He is gone in to lodge with a man that is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord , Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have wrongfully exacted aught of any man , I restore fourfold . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , To - day is salvation come to this house , forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and ' because ' they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country , to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return . <EOV> <SOV> And he called ten servants of his , and gave them ten pounds , and said unto them , Trade ye ' herewith ' till I come . <EOV> <SOV> But his citizens hated him , and sent an ambassage after him , saying , We will not that this man reign over us . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he was come back again , having received the kingdom , that he commanded these servants , unto whom he had given the money , to be called to him , that he might know what they had gained by trading . <EOV> <SOV> And the first came before him , saying , Lord , thy pound hath made ten pounds more . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Well done , thou good servant : because thou wast found faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities . <EOV> <SOV> And the second came , saying , Thy pound , Lord , hath made five pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him also , Be thou also over five cities . <EOV> <SOV> And another came , saying , Lord , behold , ' here is ' thy pound , which I kept laid up in a napkin : <EOV> <SOV> for I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that which thou layedst not down , and reapest that which thou didst not sow . <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I am an austere man , taking up that which I laid not down , and reaping that which I did not sow ; <EOV> <SOV> then wherefore gavest thou not my money into the bank , and I at my coming should have required it with interest ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them that stood by , Take away from him the pound , and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , that unto every one that hath shall be given ; but from him that hath not , even that which he hath shall be taken away from him . <EOV> <SOV> But these mine enemies , that would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , he went on before , going up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he drew nigh unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount that is called Olivet , he sent two of the disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Go your way into the village over against ' you ' ; in which as ye enter ye shall find a colt tied , whereon no man ever yet sat : loose him , and bring him . <EOV> <SOV> And if any one ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say , The Lord hath need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were sent went away , and found even as he had said unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , The Lord hath need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought him to Jesus : and they threw their garments upon the colt , and set Jesus thereon . <EOV> <SOV> And as he went , they spread their garments in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was now drawing nigh , ' even ' at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen ; <EOV> <SOV> saying , Blessed ' is ' the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him , Teacher , rebuke thy disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , I tell you that , if these shall hold their peace , the stones will cry out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he drew nigh , he saw the city and wept over it , <EOV> <SOV> saying , If thou hadst known in this day , even thou , the things which belong unto peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes . <EOV> <SOV> For the days shall come upon thee , when thine enemies shall cast up a bank about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side , <EOV> <SOV> and shall dash thee to the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation . <EOV> <SOV> And he entered into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold , <EOV> <SOV> saying unto them , It is written , And my house shall be a house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of robbers . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him : <EOV> <SOV> and they could not find what they might do ; for the people all hung upon him , listening . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , on one of the days , as he was teaching the people in the temple , and preaching the gospel , there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders ; <EOV> <SOV> and they spake , saying unto him , Tell us : By what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , I also will ask you a question ; and tell me : <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> But if we shall say , From men ; all the people will stone us : for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered , that they knew not whence ' it was ' . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to speak unto the people this parable : A man planted a vineyard , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into another country for a long time . <EOV> <SOV> And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent yet another servant : and him also they beat , and handled him shamefully , and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent yet a third : and him also they wounded , and cast him forth . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son ; it may be they will reverence him . <EOV> <SOV> But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned one with another , saying , This is the heir ; let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . <EOV> <SOV> And they cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them ? <EOV> <SOV> He will come and destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid . <EOV> <SOV> But he looked upon them , and said , What then is this that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ? <EOV> <SOV> Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will scatter him as dust . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he spake this parable against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they watched him , and sent forth spies , who feigned themselves to be righteous , that they might take hold of his speech , so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , Teacher , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , and acceptest not the person ' of any ' , but of a truth teachest the way of God : <EOV> <SOV> Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> Show me a denarius . Whose image and superscription hath it ? And they said , Caesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's . <EOV> <SOV> And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace . <EOV> <SOV> And there came to him certain of the Sadducees , they that say that there is no resurrection ; <EOV> <SOV> and they asked him , saying , Teacher , Moses wrote unto us , that if a man 's brother die , having a wife , and he be childless , his brother should take the wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . <EOV> <SOV> There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died childless ; <EOV> <SOV> and the second : <EOV> <SOV> and the third took her ; and likewise the seven also left no children , and died . <EOV> <SOV> Afterward the woman also died . <EOV> <SOV> In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be ? for the seven had her to wife . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , The sons of this world marry , and are given in marriage : <EOV> <SOV> but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage : <EOV> <SOV> for neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection . <EOV> <SOV> But that the dead are raised , even Moses showed , in ' the place concerning ' the Bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . <EOV> <SOV> Now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of the scribes answering said , Teacher , thou hast well said . <EOV> <SOV> For they durst not any more ask him any question . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , How say they that the Christ is David 's son ? <EOV> <SOV> For David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , <EOV> <SOV> Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet . <EOV> <SOV> David therefore calleth him Lord , and how is he his son ? <EOV> <SOV> And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and love salutations in the marketplaces , and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts ; <EOV> <SOV> who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater condemnation . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he looked up , and saw the rich men that were casting their gifts into the treasury . <EOV> <SOV> And he saw a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , This poor widow cast in more than they all : <EOV> <SOV> for all these did of their superfluity cast in unto the gifts ; but she of her want did cast in all the living that she had . <EOV> <SOV> And as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings , he said , <EOV> <SOV> As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , Teacher , when therefore shall these things be ? and what ' shall be ' the sign when these things are about to come to pass ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Take heed that ye be not led astray : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am ' he ' ; and , The time is at hand : go ye not after them . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults , be not terrified : for these things must needs come to pass first ; but the end is not immediately . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; <EOV> <SOV> and there shall be great earthquakes , and in divers places famines and pestilences ; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But before all these things , they shall lay their hands on you , and shall persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> It shall turn out unto you for a testimony . <EOV> <SOV> Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate beforehand how to answer : <EOV> <SOV> for I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand or to gainsay . <EOV> <SOV> But ye shall be delivered up even by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolk , and friends ; and ' some ' of you shall they cause to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> And not a hair of your head shall perish . <EOV> <SOV> In your patience ye shall win your souls . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that her desolation is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> Then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains ; and let them that are in the midst of her depart out ; and let not them that are in the country enter therein . <EOV> <SOV> For these are days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days ! for there shall be great distress upon the land , and wrath unto this people . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led captive into all the nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows ; <EOV> <SOV> men fainting for fear , and for expectation of the things which are coming on the world : for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> But when these things begin to come to pass , look up , and lift up your heads ; because your redemption draweth nigh . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake to them a parable : Behold the fig tree , and all the trees : <EOV> <SOV> when they now shoot forth , ye see it and know of your own selves that the summer is now nigh . <EOV> <SOV> Even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all things be accomplished . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But take heed to yourselves , lest haply your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and that day come on you suddenly as a snare : <EOV> <SOV> for ' so ' shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of all the earth . <EOV> <SOV> But watch ye at every season , making supplication , that ye may prevail to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> And every day he was teaching in the temple ; and every night he went out , and lodged in the mount that is called Olivet . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , to hear him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death ; for they feared the people . <EOV> <SOV> And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And he went away , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might deliver him unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money . <EOV> <SOV> And he consented , and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And the day of unleavened bread came , on which the passover must be sacrificed . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and make ready for us the passover , that we may eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , Where wilt thou that we make ready ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall say unto the master of the house , The Teacher saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And he will show you a large upper room furnished : there make ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the apostles with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer : <EOV> <SOV> for I say unto you , I shall not eat it , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he received a cup , and when he had given thanks , he said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves : <EOV> <SOV> for I say unto you , I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come . <EOV> <SOV> And he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and gave to them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me . <EOV> <SOV> And the cup in like manner after supper , saying , This cup is the new covenant in my blood , ' even ' that which is poured out for you . <EOV> <SOV> But behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man indeed goeth , as it hath been determined : but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed ! <EOV> <SOV> And they began to question among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing . <EOV> <SOV> And there arose also a contention among them , which of them was accounted to be greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them ; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors . <EOV> <SOV> But ye ' shall ' not ' be ' so : but he that is the greater among you , let him become as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve . <EOV> <SOV> For which is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth . <EOV> <SOV> But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations ; <EOV> <SOV> and I appoint unto you a kingdom , even as my Father appointed unto me , <EOV> <SOV> that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom ; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Simon , Simon , behold , Satan asked to have you , that he might sift you as wheat : <EOV> <SOV> but I made supplication for thee , that thy faith fail not ; and do thou , when once thou hast turned again , establish thy brethren . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Lord , with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , When I sent you forth without purse , and wallet , and shoes , lacked ye anything ? And they said , Nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise a wallet ; and he that hath none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that this which is written must be fulfilled in me , And he was reckoned with transgressors : for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough . <EOV> <SOV> And he came out , and went , as his custom was , unto the mount of Olives ; and the disciples also followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And he was parted from them about a stone 's cast ; and he kneeled down and prayed , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven , strengthening him . <EOV> <SOV> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly ; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And when he rose up from his prayer , he came unto the disciples , and found them sleeping for sorrow , <EOV> <SOV> and said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , that ye enter not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> While he yet spake , behold , a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them ; and he drew near unto Jesus to kiss him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ? <EOV> <SOV> And when they that were about him saw what would follow , they said , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ? <EOV> <SOV> And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his right ear . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye ' them ' thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and elders , that were come against him , Are ye come out , as against a robber , with swords and staves ? <EOV> <SOV> When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched not forth your hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . <EOV> <SOV> And they seized him , and led him ' away ' , and brought him into the high priest 's house . But Peter followed afar off . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court , and had sat down together , Peter sat in the midst of them . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light ' of the fire ' , and looking stedfastly upon him , said , This man also was with him . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied , saying , Woman , I know him not . <EOV> <SOV> And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou also art ' one ' of them . But Peter said , Man , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this man also was with him ; for he is a Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how that he said unto him , Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> And he went out , and wept bitterly . <EOV> <SOV> And the men that held ' Jesus ' mocked him , and beat him . <EOV> <SOV> And they blindfolded him , and asked him , saying , Prophesy : who is he that struck thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And many other things spake they against him , reviling him . <EOV> <SOV> And as soon as it was day , the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together , both chief priests and scribes ; and they led him away into their council , saying , <EOV> <SOV> If thou art the Christ , tell us . But he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe : <EOV> <SOV> and if I ask ' you ' , ye will not answer . <EOV> <SOV> But from henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they all said , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said unto them , Ye say that I am . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , What further need have we of witness ? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the whole company of them rose up , and brought him before Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this man perverting our nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , and saying that he himself is Christ a king . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said , Thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes , I find no fault in this man . <EOV> <SOV> But they were the more urgent , saying , He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Judaea , and beginning from Galilee even unto this place . <EOV> <SOV> But when Pilate heard it , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> And when he knew that he was of Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him unto Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was of a long time desirous to see him , because he had heard concerning him ; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him . <EOV> <SOV> And he questioned him in many words ; but he answered him nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes stood , vehemently accusing him . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought , and mocked him , and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day : for before they were at enmity between themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people , <EOV> <SOV> and said unto them , Ye brought unto me this man , as one that perverteth the people : and behold , I having examined him before you , found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him : <EOV> <SOV> no , nor yet Herod : for he sent him back unto us ; and behold , nothing worthy of death hath been done by him . <EOV> <SOV> I will therefore chastise him , and release him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner . ' <EOV> <SOV> But they cried out all together , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas : -- <EOV> <SOV> one who for a certain insurrection made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate spake unto them again , desiring to release Jesus ; <EOV> <SOV> but they shouted , saying , Crucify , crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath this man done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore chastise him and release him . <EOV> <SOV> But they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be crucified . And their voices prevailed . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done . <EOV> <SOV> And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison , whom they asked for ; but Jesus he delivered up to their will . <EOV> <SOV> And when they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country , and laid on him the cross , to bear it after Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And there followed him a great multitude of the people , and of women who bewailed and lamented him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus turning unto them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children . <EOV> <SOV> For behold , the days are coming , in which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the breasts that never gave suck . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us . <EOV> <SOV> For if they do these things in the green tree , what shall be done in the dry ? <EOV> <SOV> And there were also two others , malefactors , led with him to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came unto the place which is called The skull , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand and the other on the left . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . And parting his garments among them , they cast lots . <EOV> <SOV> And the people stood beholding . And the rulers also scoffed at him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , offering him vinegar , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , If thou art the King of the Jews , save thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And there was also a superscription over him , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him , saying , Art not thou the Christ ? save thyself and us . <EOV> <SOV> But the other answered , and rebuking him said , Dost thou not even fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ? <EOV> <SOV> And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Jesus , remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , To - day shalt thou be with me in Paradise . <EOV> <SOV> And it was now about the sixth hour , and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour , <EOV> <SOV> the sun 's light failing : and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , crying with a loud voice , said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said this , he gave up the ghost . <EOV> <SOV> And when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man . <EOV> <SOV> And all the multitudes that came together to this sight , when they beheld the things that were done , returned smiting their breasts . <EOV> <SOV> And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed with him from Galilee , stood afar off , seeing these things . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a man named Joseph , who was a councillor , a good and righteous man <EOV> <SOV> ( he had not consented to their counsel and deed ) , ' a man ' of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who was looking for the kingdom of God : <EOV> <SOV> this man went to Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone , where never man had yet lain . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the day of the Preparation , and the sabbath drew on . <EOV> <SOV> And the women , who had come with him out of Galilee , followed after , and beheld the tomb , and how his body was laid . <EOV> <SOV> And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments . And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But on the first day of the week , at early dawn , they came unto the tomb , bringing the spices which they had prepared . <EOV> <SOV> And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while they were perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in dazzling apparel : <EOV> <SOV> and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And they remembered his words , <EOV> <SOV> and returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest . <EOV> <SOV> Now they were Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the ' mother ' of James : and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles . <EOV> <SOV> And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk ; and they disbelieved them . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter arose , and ran unto the tomb ; and stooping and looking in , he seeth the linen cloths by themselves ; and he departed to his home , wondering at that which was come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus , which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while they communed and questioned together , that Jesus himself drew near , and went with them . <EOV> <SOV> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , What communications are these that ye have one with another , as ye walk ? And they stood still , looking sad . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , named Cleopas , answering said unto him , Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , What things ? And they said unto him , The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people : <EOV> <SOV> and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and crucified him . <EOV> <SOV> But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel . Yea and besides all this , it is now the third day since these things came to pass . <EOV> <SOV> Moreover certain women of our company amazed us , having been early at the tomb ; <EOV> <SOV> and when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , O foolish men , and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken ! <EOV> <SOV> Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things , and to enter into his glory ? <EOV> <SOV> And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself . <EOV> <SOV> And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they were going : and he made as though he would go further . <EOV> <SOV> And they constrained him , saying , Abide with us ; for it is toward evening , and the day is now far spent . And he went in to abide with them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he had sat down with them to meat , he took the bread and blessed ; and breaking ' it ' he gave to them . <EOV> <SOV> And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight . <EOV> <SOV> And they said one to another , Was not our heart burning within us , while he spake to us in the way , while he opened to us the scriptures ? <EOV> <SOV> And they rose up that very hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them , <EOV> <SOV> saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon . <EOV> <SOV> And they rehearsed the things ' that happened ' in the way , and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread . <EOV> <SOV> And as they spake these things , he himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace ' be ' unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they beheld a spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart ? <EOV> <SOV> See my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye behold me having . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his feet . <EOV> <SOV> And while they still disbelieved for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here anything to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish . <EOV> <SOV> And he took it , and ate before them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , These are my words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must needs be fulfilled , which are written in the law of Moses , and the prophets , and the psalms , concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> Then opened he their mind , that they might understand the scriptures ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto them , Thus it is written , that the Christ should suffer , and rise again from the dead the third day ; <EOV> <SOV> and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are witnesses of these things . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , I send forth the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city , until ye be clothed with power from on high . <EOV> <SOV> And he led them out until ' they were ' over against Bethany : and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he parted from them , and was carried up into heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy : <EOV> <SOV> and were continually in the temple , blessing God . <EOV> <EOC>
