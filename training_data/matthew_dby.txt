<SOC> <SOV> Book of the generation of Jesus Christ , Son of David , Son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob , and Jacob begat Juda and his brethren ; <EOV> <SOV> and Juda begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom , and Esrom begat Aram , <EOV> <SOV> and Aram begat Aminadab , and Aminadab begat Naasson , and Naasson begat Salmon , <EOV> <SOV> and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesse begat David the king . And David begat Solomon , of her [ that had been the wife ] of Urias ; <EOV> <SOV> and Solomon begat Roboam , and Roboam begat Abia , and Abia begat Asa , <EOV> <SOV> and Asa begat Josaphat , and Josaphat begat Joram , and Joram begat Ozias , <EOV> <SOV> and Ozias begat Joatham , and Joatham begat Achaz , and Achaz begat Ezekias , <EOV> <SOV> and Ezekias begat Manasses , and Manasses begat Amon , and Amon begat Josias , <EOV> <SOV> and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , at the time of the carrying away of Babylon . <EOV> <SOV> And after the carrying away of Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel , and Salathiel begat Zorobabel , <EOV> <SOV> and Zorobabel begat Abiud , and Abiud begat Eliakim , and Eliakim begat Azor , <EOV> <SOV> and Azor begat Sadoc , and Sadoc begat Achim , and Achim begat Eliud , <EOV> <SOV> and Eliud begat Eliazar , and Eliazar begat Matthan , and Matthan begat Jacob , <EOV> <SOV> and Jacob begat Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ . <EOV> <SOV> All the generations , therefore , from Abraham to David [ were ] fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon , fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ , fourteen generations . <EOV> <SOV> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus : His mother , Mary , that is , having been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together , she was found to be with child of [ the ] Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> But Joseph , her husband , being [ a ] righteous [ man ] , and unwilling to expose her publicly , purposed to have put her away secretly ; <EOV> <SOV> but while he pondered on these things , behold , an angel of [ the ] Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , Joseph , son of David , fear not to take to [ thee ] Mary , thy wife , for that which is begotten in her is of [ the ] Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus , for * he * shall save his people from their sins . <EOV> <SOV> Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [ the ] Lord , through the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which is , being interpreted , ' God with us . ' <EOV> <SOV> But Joseph , having awoke up from his sleep , did as the angel of [ the ] Lord had enjoined him , and took to [ him ] his wife , <EOV> <SOV> and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name Jesus . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judaea , in the days of Herod the king , behold magi from the east arrived at Jerusalem , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Where is the king of the Jews that has been born ? for we have seen his star in the east , and have come to do him homage . <EOV> <SOV> But Herod the king having heard [ of it ] , was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him ; <EOV> <SOV> and , assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the Christ should be born . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , In Bethlehem of Judaea ; for thus it is written through the prophet : <EOV> <SOV> And * thou * Bethlehem , land of Juda , art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda ; for out of thee shall go forth a leader who shall shepherd my people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod , having secretly called the magi , inquired of them accurately the time of the star that was appearing ; <EOV> <SOV> and having sent them to Bethlehem , said , Go , search out accurately concerning the child , and when ye shall have found [ him ] bring me back word , so that * I * also may come and do him homage . <EOV> <SOV> And they having heard the king went their way ; and lo , the star , which they had seen in the east , went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy . <EOV> <SOV> And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother , and falling down did him homage . And having opened their treasures , they offered to him gifts , gold , and frankincense , and myrrh . <EOV> <SOV> And being divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way . <EOV> <SOV> Now , they having departed , behold , an angel of [ the ] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph , saying , Arise , take to [ thee ] the little child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be there until I shall tell thee ; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it . <EOV> <SOV> And , having arisen , he took to [ him ] the little child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt . <EOV> <SOV> And he was there until the death of Herod , that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [ the ] Lord through the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son . <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod , seeing that he had been mocked by the magi , was greatly enraged ; and sent and slew all the boys which [ were ] in Bethlehem , and in all its borders , from two years and under , according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> A voice has been heard in Rama , weeping , and great lamentation : Rachel weeping [ for ] her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not . <EOV> <SOV> But Herod having died , behold , an angel of [ the ] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Arise , take to [ thee ] the little child and its mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they who sought the life of the little child are dead . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose and took to [ him ] the little child and its mother , and came into the land of Israel ; <EOV> <SOV> but having heard that ' Archelaus reigns over Judaea , instead of Herod his father , ' he was afraid to go there ; and having been divinely instructed in a dream , he went away into the parts of Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth ; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets , He shall be called a Nazaraean . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now in those days comes John the baptist , preaching in the wilderness of Judaea , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , Repent , for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh . <EOV> <SOV> For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet , saying , Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness : prepare ye the way of [ the ] Lord , make straight his paths . <EOV> <SOV> And John himself had his garment of camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins , and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey . <EOV> <SOV> Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the country round the Jordan , <EOV> <SOV> and were baptised by him in the Jordan , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said to them , Offspring of vipers , who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath ? <EOV> <SOV> Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance . <EOV> <SOV> And do not think to say within yourselves , We have Abraham for [ our ] father ; for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees ; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> * I * indeed baptise you with water to repentance , but he that comes after me is mightier than I , whose sandals I am not fit to bear ; * he * shall baptise you with [ the ] Holy Spirit and fire ; <EOV> <SOV> whose winnowing fan [ is ] in his hand , and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing - floor , and shall gather his wheat into the garner , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . <EOV> <SOV> Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John , to be baptised of him ; <EOV> <SOV> but John urgently forbad him , saying , * I * have need to be baptised of thee ; and comest * thou * to me ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answering said to him , Suffer [ it ] now ; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffers him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having been baptised , went up straightway from the water , and lo , the heavens were opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him : <EOV> <SOV> and behold , a voice out of the heavens saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I have found my delight . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil : <EOV> <SOV> and having fasted forty days and forty nights , afterwards he hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And the tempter coming up to him said , If thou be Son of God , speak , that these stones may become loaves of bread . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word which goes out through God 's mouth . <EOV> <SOV> Then the devil takes him to the holy city , and sets him upon the edge of the temple , <EOV> <SOV> and says to him , If thou be Son of God cast thyself down ; for it is written , He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee , and on [ their ] hands shall they bear thee , lest in anywise thou strike thy foot against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , It is again written , Thou shalt not tempt [ the ] Lord thy God . <EOV> <SOV> Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain , and shews him all the kingdoms of the world , and their glory , <EOV> <SOV> and says to him , All these things will I give thee if , falling down , thou wilt do me homage . <EOV> <SOV> Then says Jesus to him , Get thee away , Satan , for it is written , Thou shalt do homage to [ the ] Lord thy God , and him alone shalt thou serve . <EOV> <SOV> Then the devil leaves him , and behold , angels came and ministered to him . <EOV> <SOV> But having heard that John was delivered up , he departed into Galilee : <EOV> <SOV> and having left Nazareth , he went and dwelt at Capernaum , which is on the sea - side in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim , <EOV> <SOV> that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Land of Zabulon and land of Nepthalim , way of [ the ] sea beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the nations : <EOV> <SOV> -- the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light , and to those sitting in [ the ] country and shadow of death , to them has light sprung up . <EOV> <SOV> From that time began Jesus to preach and to say , Repent , for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh . <EOV> <SOV> And walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brothers , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea , for they were fishers ; <EOV> <SOV> and he says to them , Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men . <EOV> <SOV> And they , having left their trawl - nets , immediately followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And going on thence he saw other two brothers , James the [ son ] of Zebedee and John his brother , in the ship with Zebedee their father , mending their trawl - nets , and he called them ; <EOV> <SOV> and they , having left the ship and their father , immediately followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And [ Jesus ] went round the whole [ of ] Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people . <EOV> <SOV> And his fame went out into the whole [ of ] Syria , and they brought to him all that were ill , suffering under various diseases and pains , and those possessed by demons , and lunatics , and paralytics ; and he healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And great crowds followed him from Galilee , and Decapolis , and Jerusalem , and Judaea , and beyond the Jordan . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But seeing the crowds , he went up into the mountain , and having sat down , his disciples came to him ; <EOV> <SOV> and , having opened his mouth , he taught them , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Blessed [ are ] the poor in spirit , for * theirs * is the kingdom of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed they that mourn , for * they * shall be comforted . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed the meek , for * they * shall inherit the earth . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed they who hunger and thirst after righteousness , for * they * shall be filled . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed the merciful , for * they * shall find mercy . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed the pure in heart , for * they * shall see God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed the peace - makers , for * they * shall be called sons of God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed they who are persecuted on account of righteousness , for * theirs * is the kingdom of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye when they may reproach and persecute you , and say every wicked thing against you , lying , for my sake . <EOV> <SOV> Rejoice and exult , for your reward is great in the heavens ; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you . <EOV> <SOV> * Ye * are the salt of the earth ; but if the salt have become insipid , wherewith shall it be salted ? It is no longer fit for anything but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men . <EOV> <SOV> * Ye * are the light of the world : a city situated on the top of a mountain can not be hid . <EOV> <SOV> Nor do [ men ] light a lamp and put it under the bushel , but upon the lamp - stand , and it shines for all who are in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Let your light thus shine before men , so that they may see your upright works , and glorify your Father who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Think not that I am come to make void the law or the prophets ; I am not come to make void , but to fulfil . <EOV> <SOV> For verily I say unto you , Until the heaven and the earth pass away , one iota or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever then shall do away with one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens ; but whosoever shall practise and teach [ them ] , * he * shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that unless your righteousness surpass [ that ] of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients , Thou shalt not kill ; but whosoever shall kill shall be subject to the judgment . <EOV> <SOV> But * I * say unto you , that every one that is lightly angry with his brother shall be subject to the judgment ; but whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be subject to [ be called before ] the sanhedrim ; but whosoever shall say , Fool , shall be subject to the penalty of the hell of fire . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar , and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee , <EOV> <SOV> leave there thy gift before the altar , and first go , be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift . <EOV> <SOV> Make friends with thine adverse party quickly , whilst thou art in the way with him ; lest some time the adverse party deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to thee , Thou shalt in no wise come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it has been said , Thou shalt not commit adultery . <EOV> <SOV> But * I * say unto you , that every one who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart . <EOV> <SOV> But if thy right eye be a snare to thee , pluck it out and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy right hand be a snare to thee , cut it off and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell . <EOV> <SOV> It has been said too , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a letter of divorce . <EOV> <SOV> But * I * say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , except for cause of fornication , makes her commit adultery , and whosoever marries one that is put away commits adultery . <EOV> <SOV> Again , ye have heard that it has been said to the ancients , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt render to the Lord what thou hast sworn . <EOV> <SOV> But * I * say unto you , Do not swear at all ; neither by the heaven , because it is [ the ] throne of God ; <EOV> <SOV> nor by the earth , because it is [ the ] footstool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , because it is [ the ] city of the great King . <EOV> <SOV> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black . <EOV> <SOV> But let your word be Yea , yea ; Nay , nay ; but what is more than these is from evil . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it has been said , Eye for eye and tooth for tooth . <EOV> <SOV> But * I * say unto you , not to resist evil ; but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek , turn to him also the other ; <EOV> <SOV> and to him that would go to law with thee and take thy body coat , leave him thy cloak also . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever will compel thee to go one mile , go with him two . <EOV> <SOV> To him that asks of thee give , and from him that desires to borrow of thee turn not away . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it has been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy . <EOV> <SOV> But * I * say unto you , Love your enemies , [ bless those who curse you , ] do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who [ insult you and ] persecute you , <EOV> <SOV> that ye may be [ the ] sons of your Father who is in [ the ] heavens ; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good , and sends rain on just and unjust . <EOV> <SOV> For if ye should love those who love you , what reward have ye ? Do not also the tax - gatherers the same ? <EOV> <SOV> And if ye should salute your brethren only , what do ye extraordinary ? Do not also the Gentiles the same ? <EOV> <SOV> Be * ye * therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Take heed not to do your alms before men to be seen of them , otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore thou doest alms , sound not a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , so that they may have glory from men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But thou , when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does ; <EOV> <SOV> so that thine alms may be in secret , and thy Father who sees in secret will render [ it ] to thee . <EOV> <SOV> And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites ; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets so that they should appear to men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But * thou * , when thou prayest , enter into thy chamber , and having shut thy door , pray to thy Father who is in secret , and thy Father who sees in secret will render [ it ] to thee . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as those who are of the nations : for they think they shall be heard through their much speaking . <EOV> <SOV> Be not ye therefore like them , for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye beg [ anything ] of him . <EOV> <SOV> Thus therefore pray * ye * : Our Father who art in the heavens , let thy name be sanctified , <EOV> <SOV> let thy kingdom come , let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth ; <EOV> <SOV> give us to - day our needed bread , <EOV> <SOV> and forgive us our debts , as we also forgive our debtors , <EOV> <SOV> and lead us not into temptation , but save us from evil . <EOV> <SOV> For if ye forgive men their offences , your heavenly Father also will forgive you [ yours ] , <EOV> <SOV> but if ye do not forgive men their offences , neither will your Father forgive your offences . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye fast , be not as the hypocrites , downcast in countenance ; for they disfigure their faces , so that they may appear fasting to men : verily I say unto you , They have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But * thou * , [ when ] fasting , anoint thy head and wash thy face , <EOV> <SOV> so that thou mayest not appear fasting unto men , but to thy Father who is in secret ; and thy Father who sees in secret shall render [ it ] to thee . <EOV> <SOV> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust spoils , and where thieves dig through and steal ; <EOV> <SOV> but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust spoils , and where thieves do not dig through nor steal ; <EOV> <SOV> for where thy treasure is , there will be also thy heart . <EOV> <SOV> The lamp of the body is the eye ; if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body will be light : <EOV> <SOV> but if thine eye be wicked , thy whole body will be dark . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great the darkness ! <EOV> <SOV> No one can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one and will love the other , or he will hold to the one and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause I say unto you , Do not be careful about your life , what ye should eat and what ye should drink ; nor for your body what ye should put on . Is not the life more than food , and the body than raiment ? <EOV> <SOV> Look at the birds of the heaven , that they sow not , nor reap , nor gather into granaries , and your heavenly Father nourishes them . Are * ye * not much more excellent than they ? <EOV> <SOV> But which of you by carefulness can add to his growth one cubit ? <EOV> <SOV> And why are ye careful about clothing ? Observe with attention the lilies of the field , how they grow : they toil not , neither do they spin ; <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you , that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these . <EOV> <SOV> But if God so clothe the herbage of the field , which is to - day , and to - morrow is cast into [ the ] oven , will he not much rather you , O [ ye ] of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> Be not therefore careful , saying , What shall we eat ? or What shall we drink ? or What shall we put on ? <EOV> <SOV> for all these things the nations seek after ; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things . <EOV> <SOV> But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Be not careful therefore for the morrow , for the morrow shall be careful about itself . Sufficient to the day [ is ] its own evil . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Judge not , that ye may not be judged ; <EOV> <SOV> for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged ; and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you . <EOV> <SOV> But why lookest thou on the mote that is in the eye of thy brother , but observest not the beam that is in thine eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Allow [ me ] , I will cast out the mote from thine eye ; and behold , the beam is in thine eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine eye , and then thou wilt see clearly to cast out the mote out of the eye of thy brother . <EOV> <SOV> Give not that which is holy to the dogs , nor cast your pearls before the swine , lest they trample them with their feet , and turning round rend you . <EOV> <SOV> Ask , and it shall be given to you . Seek , and ye shall find . Knock , and it shall be opened to you . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that asks receives ; and he that seeks finds ; and to him that knocks it shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> Or what man is there of you who , if his son shall ask of him a loaf of bread , will give him a stone ; <EOV> <SOV> and if he ask a fish , will give him a serpent ? <EOV> <SOV> If therefore * ye * , being wicked , know [ how ] to give good gifts to your children , how much rather shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to them that ask of him ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore all things whatever ye desire that men should do to you , thus do * ye * also do to them ; for this is the law and the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Enter in through the narrow gate , for wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction , and many are they who enter in through it . <EOV> <SOV> For narrow the gate and straitened the way that leads to life , and they are few who find it . <EOV> <SOV> But beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep 's clothing , but within are ravening wolves . <EOV> <SOV> By their fruits ye shall know them . Do [ men ] gather a bunch of grapes from thorns , or from thistles figs ? <EOV> <SOV> So every good tree produces good fruits , but the worthless tree produces bad fruits . <EOV> <SOV> A good tree can not produce bad fruits , nor a worthless tree produce good fruits . <EOV> <SOV> Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> By their fruits then surely ye shall know them . <EOV> <SOV> Not every one who says to me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens , but he that does the will of my Father who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Many shall say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied through * thy * name , and through * thy * name cast out demons , and through * thy * name done many works of power ? <EOV> <SOV> and then will I avow unto them , I never knew you . Depart from me , workers of lawlessness . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever therefore hears these my words and does them , I will liken him to a prudent man , who built his house upon the rock ; <EOV> <SOV> and the rain came down , and the streams came , and the winds blew and fell upon that house , and it did not fall , for it had been founded upon the rock . <EOV> <SOV> And every one who hears these my words and does not do them , he shall be likened to a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand ; <EOV> <SOV> and the rain came down , and the streams came , and the winds blew and beat upon that house , and it fell , and its fall was great . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these words , the crowds were astonished at his doctrine , <EOV> <SOV> for he taught them as having authority , and not as their scribes . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when he had come down from the mountain , great crowds followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a leper came up to [ him ] and did him homage , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou art able to cleanse me . <EOV> <SOV> And he stretched out his hand and touched him , saying , I will ; be cleansed . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus says to him , See thou tell no man , but go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift which Moses ordained , for a testimony to them . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had entered into Capernaum , a centurion came to him , beseeching him , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , Lord , my servant lies paralytic in the house , suffering grievously . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus says to him , * I * will come and heal him . <EOV> <SOV> And the centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not fit that thou shouldest enter under my roof ; but only speak a word , and my servant shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> For * I * also am a man under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say to this [ one ] , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my bondman , Do this , and he does it . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus heard it , he wondered , and said to those who followed , Verily I say unto you , Not even in Israel have I found so great faith . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , that many shall come from [ the ] rising and setting [ sun ] , and shall lie down at table with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to the centurion , Go , and as thou hast believed , be it to thee . And his servant was healed in that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had come to Peter 's house , he saw his mother - in - law laid down and in a fever ; <EOV> <SOV> and he touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she arose and served him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the evening was come , they brought to him many possessed by demons , and he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all that were ill ; <EOV> <SOV> so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities and bore our diseases . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , seeing great crowds around him , commanded to depart to the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And a scribe came up and said to him , Teacher , I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus says to him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven roosting - places ; but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head . <EOV> <SOV> But another of his disciples said to him , Lord , suffer me first to go away and bury my father . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Follow me , and leave the dead to bury their own dead . <EOV> <SOV> And he went on board ship and his disciples followed him ; <EOV> <SOV> and behold , [ the water ] became very agitated on the sea , so that the ship was covered by the waves ; but * he * slept . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples came and awoke him , saying , Lord save : we perish . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then , having arisen , he rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm . <EOV> <SOV> But the men were astonished , saying , What sort [ of man ] is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ? <EOV> <SOV> And there met him , when he came to the other side , to the country of the Gergesenes , two possessed by demons , coming out of the tombs , exceeding dangerous , so that no one was able to pass by that way . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Son of God ? hast thou come here before the time to torment us ? <EOV> <SOV> Now there was , a great way off from them , a herd of many swine feeding ; <EOV> <SOV> and the demons besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , send us away into the herd of swine . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Go . And they , going out , departed into the herd of swine ; and lo , the whole herd [ of swine ] rushed down the steep slope into the sea , and died in the waters . <EOV> <SOV> But they that fed them fled , and went away into the city and related everything , and what had happened as to those possessed by demons . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , the whole city went out to meet Jesus ; and when they saw him , they begged [ him ] to go away out of their coasts . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And going on board the ship , he passed over and came to his own city . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , they brought to him a paralytic , laid upon a bed ; and Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paralytic , Be of good courage , child ; thy sins are forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , certain of the scribes said to themselves , This [ man ] blasphemes . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , seeing their thoughts , said , Why do * ye * think evil things in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> For which is easier : to say , Thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , Rise up and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins , ( then he says to the paralytic , ) Rise up , take up thy bed and go to thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he rose up and went to his house . <EOV> <SOV> But the crowds seeing [ it ] , were in fear , and glorified God who gave such power to men . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , passing on thence , saw a man sitting at the tax - office , called Matthew , and says to him , Follow me . And he rose up and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he lay at table in the house , that behold , many tax - gatherers and sinners came and lay at table with Jesus and his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees seeing [ it ] , said to his disciples , Why does your teacher eat with tax - gatherers and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> But [ Jesus ] hearing it , said , They that are strong have not need of a physician , but those that are ill . <EOV> <SOV> But go and learn what [ that ] is -- I will have mercy and not sacrifice ; for I have not come to call righteous [ men ] but sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Then come to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees often fast , but thy disciples fast not ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them ? But days will come when the bridegroom will have been taken away from them , and then they will fast . <EOV> <SOV> But no one puts a patch of new cloth on an old garment , for its filling up takes from the garment and a worse rent takes place . <EOV> <SOV> Nor do men put new wine into old skins , otherwise the skins burst and the wine is poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but they put new wine into new skins , and both are preserved together . <EOV> <SOV> As he spoke these things to them , behold , a ruler coming in did homage to him , saying , My daughter has by this died ; but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rose up and followed him , and [ so did ] his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a woman , who had had a bloody flux [ for ] twelve years , came behind and touched the hem of his garment ; <EOV> <SOV> for she said within herself , If I should only touch his garment I shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus turning and seeing her , said , Be of good courage , daughter ; thy faith has healed thee . And the woman was healed from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus was come to the house of the ruler , and saw the flute - players and the crowd making a tumult , <EOV> <SOV> he said , Withdraw , for the damsel is not dead , but sleeps . And they derided him . <EOV> <SOV> But when the crowd had been put out , he went in and took her hand ; and the damsel rose up . <EOV> <SOV> And the fame of it went out into all that land . <EOV> <SOV> And as Jesus passed on thence , two blind [ men ] followed him , crying and saying , Have mercy on us , Son of David . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come to the house , the blind [ men ] came to him . And Jesus says to them , Do ye believe that I am able to do this ? They say to him , Yea , Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Then he touched their eyes , saying , According to your faith , be it unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus charged them sharply , saying , See , let no man know it . <EOV> <SOV> But they , when they were gone out , spread his name abroad in all that land . <EOV> <SOV> But as these were going out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed by a demon . <EOV> <SOV> And the demon having been cast out , the dumb spake . And the crowds were astonished , saying , It has never been seen thus in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees said , He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went round all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom , and healing every disease and every bodily weakness . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw the crowds he was moved with compassion for them , because they were harassed , and cast away as sheep not having a shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to his disciples , The harvest [ is ] great and the workmen [ are ] few ; <EOV> <SOV> supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he send forth workmen unto his harvest . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having called to [ him ] his twelve disciples , he gave them power over unclean spirits , so that they should cast them out , and heal every disease and every bodily weakness . <EOV> <SOV> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these : first , Simon , who was called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the [ son ] of Zebedee , and John his brother ; <EOV> <SOV> Philip and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the tax - gatherer ; James the [ son ] of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , who was surnamed Thaddaeus ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon the Cananaean , and Judas the Iscariote , who also delivered him up . <EOV> <SOV> These twelve Jesus sent out when he had charged them , saying , Go not off into [ the ] way of [ the ] nations , and into a city of Samaritans enter ye not ; <EOV> <SOV> but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh . <EOV> <SOV> Heal [ the ] infirm , [ raise the dead ] , cleanse lepers , cast out demons : ye have received gratuitously , give gratuitously . <EOV> <SOV> Do not provide yourselves with gold , or silver , or brass , for your belts , <EOV> <SOV> nor scrip for the way , nor two body coats , nor sandals , nor a staff : for the workman is worthy of his nourishment . <EOV> <SOV> But into whatsoever city or village ye enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and there remain till ye go forth . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye enter into a house salute it . <EOV> <SOV> And if the house indeed be worthy , let your peace come upon it ; but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , as ye go forth out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in judgment - day than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , * I * send you as sheep in the midst of wolves ; be therefore prudent as the serpents , and guileless as the doves . <EOV> <SOV> But beware of men ; for they will deliver you up to sanhedrims , and scourge you in their synagogues ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations . <EOV> <SOV> But when they deliver you up , be not careful how or what ye shall speak ; for it shall be given to you in that hour what ye shall speak . <EOV> <SOV> For * ye * are not the speakers , but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you . <EOV> <SOV> But brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child ; and children shall rise up against parents and shall put them to death ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall be hated of all on account of my name . But he that has endured to [ the ] end , * he * shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> But when they persecute you in this city , flee to the other ; for verily I say to you , Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come . <EOV> <SOV> The disciple is not above his teacher , nor the bondman above his lord . <EOV> <SOV> [ It is ] sufficient for the disciple that he should become as his teacher , and the bondman as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more those of his household ? <EOV> <SOV> Fear them not therefore ; for there is nothing covered which shall not be revealed , and secret which shall not be known . <EOV> <SOV> What I say to you in darkness speak in the light , and what ye hear in the ear preach upon the houses . <EOV> <SOV> And be not afraid of those who kill the body , but can not kill the soul ; but fear rather him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell . <EOV> <SOV> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father ; <EOV> <SOV> but of you even the hairs of the head are all numbered . <EOV> <SOV> Fear not therefore ; * ye * are better than many sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> Every one therefore who shall confess me before men , * I * also will confess him before my Father who is in [ the ] heavens . <EOV> <SOV> But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will * I * also deny before my Father who is in [ the ] heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Do not think that I have come to send peace upon the earth : I have not come to send peace , but a sword . <EOV> <SOV> For I have come to set a man at variance with his father , and the daughter with her mother , and the daughter - in - law with her mother - in - law ; <EOV> <SOV> and they of his household [ shall be ] a man 's enemies . <EOV> <SOV> He who loves father or mother above me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter above me is not worthy of me . <EOV> <SOV> And he who does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me . <EOV> <SOV> He that finds his life shall lose it , and he who has lost his life for my sake shall find it . <EOV> <SOV> He that receives you receives me , and he that receives me receives him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet , shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man , shall receive a righteous man 's reward . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold [ water ] only , in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities . <EOV> <SOV> But John , having heard in the prison the works of the Christ , sent by his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and said to him , Art * thou * the coming [ one ] ? or are we to wait for another ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Go , report to John what ye hear and see . <EOV> <SOV> Blind [ men ] see and lame walk ; lepers are cleansed , and deaf hear ; and dead are raised , and poor have glad tidings preached to them : <EOV> <SOV> and blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me . <EOV> <SOV> But as they went [ away ] , Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a reed moved about by the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in delicate raiment ? behold , those who wear delicate things are in the houses of kings . <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and more than a prophet : <EOV> <SOV> this is he of whom it is written , Behold , * I * send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , that there is not arisen among [ the ] born of women a greater than John the baptist . But he who is a little one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> But from the days of John the baptist until now , the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence , and [ the ] violent seize on it . <EOV> <SOV> For all the prophets and the law have prophesied unto John . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , who is to come . <EOV> <SOV> He that has ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> But to whom shall I liken this generation ? It is like children sitting in the markets , which , calling to their companions , <EOV> <SOV> say , We have piped to you , and ye have not danced : we have mourned to you , and ye have not wailed . <EOV> <SOV> For John has come neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He has a demon . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man has come eating and drinking , and they say , Behold , a man [ that is ] eating and wine - drinking , a friend of tax - gatherers , and of sinners : -- and wisdom has been justified by her children . <EOV> <SOV> Then began he to reproach the cities in which most of his works of power had taken place , because they had not repented . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to thee , Chorazin ! woe to thee Bethsaida ! for if the works of power which have taken place in you , had taken place in Tyre and Sidon , they had long ago repented in sackcloth and ashes . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in judgment - day than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And * thou * , Capernaum , who hast been raised up to heaven , shalt be brought down even to hades . For if the works of power which have taken place in thee , had taken place in Sodom , it had remained until this day . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that it shall be more tolerable for [ the ] land of Sodom in judgment - day than for thee . <EOV> <SOV> At that time , Jesus answering said , I praise thee , Father , Lord of the heaven and of the earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to babes . <EOV> <SOV> Yea , Father , for thus has it been well - pleasing in thy sight . <EOV> <SOV> All things have been delivered to me by my Father , and no one knows the Son but the Father , nor does any one know the Father , but the Son , and he to whom the Son may be pleased to reveal [ him ] . <EOV> <SOV> Come to me , all ye who labour and are burdened , and * I * will give you rest . <EOV> <SOV> Take my yoke upon you , and learn from me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart ; and ye shall find rest to your souls ; <EOV> <SOV> for my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the cornfields ; and his disciples were hungry , and began to pluck the ears and to eat . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees , seeing [ it ] , said to him , Behold , thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry , and they that were with him ? <EOV> <SOV> How he entered into the house of God , and ate the shewbread , which it was not lawful for him to eat , nor for those with him , but for the priests only ? <EOV> <SOV> Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ? <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , that there is here what is greater than the temple . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye had known what is : I will have mercy and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And , going away from thence , he came into their synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a man having his hand withered . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ? that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , What man shall there be of you who has one sheep , and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath , will not lay hold of it and raise [ it ] up ? <EOV> <SOV> How much better then is a man than a sheep ! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> Then he says to the man , Stretch out thy hand . And he stretched [ it ] out , and it was restored sound as the other . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees , having gone out , took counsel against him , how they might destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus knowing [ it ] , withdrew thence , and great crowds followed him ; and he healed them all : <EOV> <SOV> and charged them strictly that they should not make him publicly known : <EOV> <SOV> that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Behold my servant , whom I have chosen , my beloved , in whom my soul has found its delight . I will put my Spirit upon him , and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations . <EOV> <SOV> He shall not strive or cry out , nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets ; <EOV> <SOV> a bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , until he bring forth judgment unto victory ; <EOV> <SOV> and on his name shall [ the ] nations hope . <EOV> <SOV> Then was brought to him one possessed by a demon , blind and dumb , and he healed him , so that the dumb [ man ] spake and saw . <EOV> <SOV> And all the crowds were amazed and said , Is this [ man ] the Son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees , having heard [ it ] , said , This [ man ] does not cast out demons , but by Beelzebub , prince of demons . <EOV> <SOV> But he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation , and every city or house divided against itself will not subsist . <EOV> <SOV> And if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom subsist ? <EOV> <SOV> And if * I * cast out demons by Beelzebub , your sons , by whom do they cast [ them ] out ? For this reason * they * shall be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if * I * by [ the ] Spirit of God cast out demons , then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you . <EOV> <SOV> Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong [ man ] and plunder his goods , unless first he bind the strong [ man ] ? and then he will plunder his house . <EOV> <SOV> He that is not with me is against me , and he that gathers not with me scatters . <EOV> <SOV> For this reason I say unto you , Every sin and injurious speaking shall be forgiven to men , but speaking injuriously of the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall have spoken a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this age nor in the coming [ one ] . <EOV> <SOV> Either make the tree good , and its fruit good ; or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt . For from the fruit the tree is known . <EOV> <SOV> Offspring of vipers ! how can ye speak good things , being wicked ? For of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks . <EOV> <SOV> The good man out of the good treasure brings forth good things ; and the wicked man out of the wicked treasure brings forth wicked things . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , that every idle word which men shall say , they shall render an account of it in judgment - day : <EOV> <SOV> for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered him some of the scribes and Pharisees , saying , Teacher , we desire to see a sign from thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he , answering , said to them , A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas the prophet . <EOV> <SOV> For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights , thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights . <EOV> <SOV> Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and behold , more than Jonas [ is ] here . <EOV> <SOV> A queen of [ the ] south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it ; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , more than Solomon [ is ] here . <EOV> <SOV> But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man , he goes through dry places , seeking rest , and does not find [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> Then he says , I will return to my house whence I came out ; and having come , he finds [ it ] unoccupied , swept , and adorned . <EOV> <SOV> Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself , and entering in , they dwell there ; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first . Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also . <EOV> <SOV> But while he was yet speaking to the crowds , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him . <EOV> <SOV> Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren are standing without , seeking to speak to thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to him that spoke to him , Who is my mother , and who are my brethren ? <EOV> <SOV> And , stretching out his hand to his disciples , he said , Behold my mother and my brethren ; <EOV> <SOV> for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in [ the ] heavens , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And that [ same ] day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And great crowds were gathered together to him , so that going on board ship himself he sat down , and the whole crowd stood on the shore . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke to them many things in parables , saying , Behold , the sower went out to sow : <EOV> <SOV> and as he sowed , some [ grains ] fell along the way , and the birds came and devoured them ; <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth , and immediately they sprang up out of [ the ground ] because of not having [ any ] depth of earth , <EOV> <SOV> but when the sun rose they were burned up , and because of not having [ any ] root were dried up ; <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked them ; <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the good ground , and produced fruit , one a hundred , one sixty , and one thirty . <EOV> <SOV> He that has ears , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples came up and said to him , Why speakest thou to them in parables ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens , but to them it is not given ; <EOV> <SOV> for whoever has , to him shall be given , and he shall be caused to be in abundance ; but he who has not , even what he has shall be taken away from him . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause I speak to them in parables , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear nor understand ; <EOV> <SOV> and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias , which says , Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand , and beholding ye shall behold and not see ; <EOV> <SOV> for the heart of this people has grown fat , and they have heard heavily with their ears , and they have closed their eyes as asleep , lest they should see with the eyes , and hear with the ears , and understand with the heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them . <EOV> <SOV> But blessed are * your * eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear ; <EOV> <SOV> for verily I say unto you , that many prophets and righteous [ men ] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [ them ] , and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> * Ye * , therefore , hear the parable of the sower . <EOV> <SOV> From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [ it ] , the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart : this is he that is sown by the wayside . <EOV> <SOV> But he that is sown on the rocky places -- this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy , <EOV> <SOV> but has no root in himself , but is for a time only ; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word , he is immediately offended . <EOV> <SOV> And he that is sown among the thorns -- this is he who hears the word , and the anxious care of this life , and the deceit of riches choke the word , and he becomes unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> But he that is sown upon the good ground -- this is he who hears and understands the word , who bears fruit also , and produces , one a hundred , one sixty , and one thirty . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field ; <EOV> <SOV> but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat , and went away . <EOV> <SOV> But when the blade shot up and produced fruit , then appeared the darnel also . <EOV> <SOV> And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him , Sir , hast thou not sown good seed in thy field ? whence then has it darnel ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , A man [ that is ] an enemy has done this . And the bondmen said to him , Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [ up ] ? <EOV> <SOV> But he said , No ; lest [ in ] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it . <EOV> <SOV> Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest , and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen , Gather first the darnel , and bind it into bundles to burn it ; but the wheat bring together into my granary . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [ seed ] which a man took and sowed in his field ; <EOV> <SOV> which is less indeed than all seeds , but when it is grown is greater than herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches . <EOV> <SOV> He spoke another parable to them : The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened . <EOV> <SOV> All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables , and without a parable he did not speak to them , <EOV> <SOV> so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden from [ the ] world 's foundation . <EOV> <SOV> Then , having dismissed the crowds , he went into the house ; and his disciples came to him , saying , Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , He that sows the good seed is the Son of man , <EOV> <SOV> and the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom , but the darnel are the sons of the evil [ one ] ; <EOV> <SOV> and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil ; and the harvest is [ the ] completion of [ the ] age , and the harvestmen are angels . <EOV> <SOV> As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire , thus it shall be in the completion of the age . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man shall send his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences , and those that practise lawlessness ; <EOV> <SOV> and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He that has ears , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field , which a man having found has hid , and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has , and buys that field . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls ; <EOV> <SOV> and having found one pearl of great value , he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea , and which has gathered together of every kind , <EOV> <SOV> which , when it has been filled , having drawn up on the shore and sat down , they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out . <EOV> <SOV> Thus shall it be in the completion of the age : the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just , <EOV> <SOV> and shall cast them into the furnace of fire ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to them , Have ye understood all these things ? They say to him , Yea , [ Lord ] . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [ that is ] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence . <EOV> <SOV> And having come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , Whence has this [ man ] this wisdom and these works of power ? <EOV> <SOV> Is not this the son of the carpenter ? Is not his mother called Mary , and his brethren James , and Joseph , and Simon , and Judas ? <EOV> <SOV> And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then has this [ man ] all these things ? <EOV> <SOV> And they were offended in him . And Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honour , unless in his country and in his house . <EOV> <SOV> And he did not there many works of power , because of their unbelief . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> and said to his servants , This is John the baptist : * he * is risen from the dead , and because of this these works of power display their force in him . <EOV> <SOV> For Herod had seized John , and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother . <EOV> <SOV> For John said to him , It is not lawful for thee to have her . <EOV> <SOV> And [ while ] desiring to kill him , he feared the crowd , because they held him for a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> But when Herod 's birthday was celebrated , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased Herod ; <EOV> <SOV> whereupon he promised with oath to give her whatsoever she should ask . <EOV> <SOV> But she , being set on by her mother , says , Give me here upon a dish the head of John the baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And the king was grieved ; but on account of the oaths , and those lying at table with [ him ] , he commanded [ it ] to be given . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent and beheaded John in the prison ; <EOV> <SOV> and his head was brought upon a dish , and was given to the damsel , and she carried [ it ] to her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples came and took the body and buried it , and came and brought word to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having heard it , went away thence by ship to a desert place apart . And the crowds having heard [ of it ] followed him on foot from the cities . <EOV> <SOV> And going out he saw a great crowd , and was moved with compassion about them , and healed their infirm . <EOV> <SOV> But when even was come , his disciples came to him saying , The place is desert , and [ much of ] the [ day ] time already gone by ; dismiss the crowds , that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to them , They have no need to go : give * ye * them to eat . <EOV> <SOV> But they say to him , We have not here save five loaves and two fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Bring them here to me . <EOV> <SOV> And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass , having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed : and having broken the loaves , he gave [ them ] to the disciples , and the disciples [ gave them ] to the crowds . <EOV> <SOV> And all ate and were filled , and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand - baskets full . <EOV> <SOV> But those that had eaten were about five thousand men , besides women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship , and to go on before him to the other side , until he should have dismissed the crowds . <EOV> <SOV> And having dismissed the crowds , he went up into the mountain apart to pray . And when even was come , he was alone there , <EOV> <SOV> but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves , for the wind was contrary . <EOV> <SOV> But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them , walking on the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples , seeing him walking on the sea , were troubled , saying , It is an apparition . And they cried out through fear . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus immediately spoke to them , saying , Take courage ; it is * I * : be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering him said , Lord , if it be * thou * , command me to come to thee upon the waters . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Come . And Peter , having descended from the ship , walked upon the waters to go to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But seeing the wind strong he was afraid ; and beginning to sink he cried out , saying , Lord , save me . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him , and says to him , O thou of little faith , why didst thou doubt ? <EOV> <SOV> And when they had gone up into the ship , the wind fell . <EOV> <SOV> But those in the ship came and did homage to him , saying , Truly thou art God 's Son . <EOV> <SOV> And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret . <EOV> <SOV> And when the men of that place recognised him , they sent to that whole country around , and they brought to him all that were ill , <EOV> <SOV> and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment ; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients ? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to them , Why do * ye * also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching ? <EOV> <SOV> For God commanded saying , Honour father and mother ; and , He that speaks ill of father or mother , let him die the death . <EOV> <SOV> But * ye * say , Whosoever shall say to his father or mother , It is a gift , whatsoever [ it be ] by which [ received ] from me thou wouldest be profited : <EOV> <SOV> and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother ; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching . <EOV> <SOV> Hypocrites ! well has Esaias prophesied about you , saying , <EOV> <SOV> This people honour me with the lips , but their heart is far away from me ; <EOV> <SOV> but in vain do they worship me , teaching [ as ] teachings commandments of men . <EOV> <SOV> And having called to [ him ] the crowd , he said to them , Hear and understand : <EOV> <SOV> Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man ; but what goes forth out of the mouth , this defiles the man . <EOV> <SOV> Then his disciples , coming up , said to him , Dost thou know that the Pharisees , having heard this word , have been offended ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up . <EOV> <SOV> Leave them alone ; they are blind leaders of blind : but if blind lead blind , both will fall into a ditch . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering said to him , Expound to us this parable . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Are * ye * also still without intelligence ? <EOV> <SOV> Do ye not yet apprehend , that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly , and is cast forth into the draught ? <EOV> <SOV> but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart , and those defile man . <EOV> <SOV> For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witnessings , blasphemies ; <EOV> <SOV> these are the things which defile man ; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , going forth from thence , went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon ; <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a Canaanitish woman , coming out from those borders , cried [ to him ] saying , Have pity on me , Lord , Son of David ; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon . <EOV> <SOV> But he did not answer her a word . And his disciples came to [ him ] and asked him , saying , Dismiss her , for she cries after us . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israel 's house . <EOV> <SOV> But she came and did him homage , saying , Lord , help me . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs . <EOV> <SOV> But she said , Yea , Lord ; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus answering said to her , O woman , thy faith [ is ] great . Be it to thee as thou desirest . And her daughter was healed from * that * hour . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , going away from thence , came towards the sea of Galilee , and he went up into the mountain and sat down there ; <EOV> <SOV> and great crowds came to him , having with them lame , blind , dumb , crippled , and many others , and they cast them at his feet , and he healed them : <EOV> <SOV> so that the crowds wondered , seeing dumb speaking , crippled sound , lame walking , and blind seeing ; and they glorified the God of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , having called his disciples to [ him ] , said , I have compassion on the crowd , because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat , and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples say to him , Whence should we have so many loaves in [ the ] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus says to them , How many loaves have ye ? But they said , Seven , and a few small fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground ; <EOV> <SOV> and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes , having given thanks , he broke [ them ] and gave [ them ] to his disciples , and the disciples to the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> And all ate and were filled ; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments seven baskets full ; <EOV> <SOV> but they that ate were four thousand men , besides women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And , having dismissed the crowds , he went on board ship and came to the borders of Magadan . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the Pharisees and Sadducees , coming to [ him ] , asked him , tempting [ him ] , to shew them a sign out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to them , When evening is come , ye say , Fine weather , for the sky is red ; <EOV> <SOV> and in the morning , A storm to - day , for the sky is red [ and ] lowering ; ye know [ how ] to discern the face of the sky , but ye can not the signs of the times . <EOV> <SOV> A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas . And he left them and went away . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned among themselves , saying , Because we have taken no bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus knowing [ it ] , said , Why reason ye among yourselves , O ye of little faith , because ye have taken no bread ? <EOV> <SOV> Do ye not yet understand nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many hand - baskets ye took [ up ] ? <EOV> <SOV> nor the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took [ up ] ? <EOV> <SOV> How do ye not understand that [ it was ] not concerning bread I said to you , Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they comprehended that he did not speak of being beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus was come into the parts of Caesarea - Philippi , he demanded of his disciples , saying , Who do men say that I the Son of man am ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Some , John the baptist ; and others , Elias ; and others again , Jeremias or one of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> He says to them , But * ye * , who do ye say that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter answering said , * Thou * art the Christ , the Son of the living God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him , Blessed art thou , Simon Bar - jona , for flesh and blood has not revealed [ it ] to thee , but my Father who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> And * I * also , I say unto thee that * thou * art Peter , and on this rock I will build my assembly , and hades ' gates shall not prevail against it . <EOV> <SOV> And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens ; and whatsoever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens ; and whatsoever thou mayest loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Then he enjoined on his disciples that they should say to no man that he was the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples that he must go away to Jerusalem , and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter taking him to [ him ] began to rebuke him , saying , [ God ] be favourable to thee , Lord ; this shall in no wise be unto thee . <EOV> <SOV> But turning round , he said to Peter , Get away behind me , Satan ; thou art an offence to me , for thy mind is not on the things that are of God , but on the things that are of men . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said to his disciples , If any one desires to come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it . <EOV> <SOV> For what does a man profit , if he should gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels , and then he will render to each according to his doings . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , There are some of those standing here that shall not taste of death at all until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And after six days Jesus takes with [ him ] Peter , and James , and John his brother , and brings them up into a high mountain apart . <EOV> <SOV> And he was transfigured before them . And his face shone as the sun , and his garments became white as the light ; <EOV> <SOV> and lo , Moses and Elias appeared to them talking with him . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering said to Jesus , Lord , it is good we should be here . If thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles : for thee one , and for Moses one , and one for Elias . <EOV> <SOV> While he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and lo , a voice out of the cloud , saying , * This * is my beloved Son , in whom I have found my delight : hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples hearing [ it ] fell upon their faces , and were greatly terrified . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus coming to [ them ] touched them , and said , Rise up , and be not terrified . <EOV> <SOV> And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one but Jesus alone . <EOV> <SOV> And as they descended from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no one , until the Son of man be risen up from among [ the ] dead . <EOV> <SOV> And [ his ] disciples demanded of him saying , Why then say the scribes that Elias must first have come ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you that Elias has already come , and they have not known him , but have done unto him whatever they would . Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came to the crowd , a man came to him , falling on his knees before him , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is lunatic , and suffers sorely ; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water . <EOV> <SOV> And I brought him to thy disciples , and they were not able to heal him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , O unbelieving and perverted generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? Bring him here to me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , and the demon went out from him , and the boy was healed from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples , coming to Jesus apart , said [ to him ] , Why were not * we * able to cast him out ? <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Because of your unbelief ; for verily I say unto you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [ seed ] , ye shall say to this mountain , Be transported hence there , and it shall transport itself ; and nothing shall be impossible to you . <EOV> <SOV> But this kind does not go out but by prayer and fasting . <EOV> <SOV> And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said to them , The Son of man is about to be delivered up into [ the ] hands of men , <EOV> <SOV> and they shall kill him ; and the third day he shall be raised up . And they were greatly grieved . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came to Capernaum , those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said , Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas ? <EOV> <SOV> He says , Yes . And when he came into the house , Jesus anticipated him , saying , What dost thou think , Simon ? the kings of the earth , from whom do they receive custom or tribute ? from their own sons or from strangers ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter says to him , From strangers . Jesus said to him , Then are the sons free . <EOV> <SOV> But that we may not be an offence to them , go to the sea and cast a hook , and take the first fish that comes up , and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater ; take that and give it to them for me and thee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying , Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having called a little child to [ him ] , set it in their midst , <EOV> <SOV> and said , Verily I say to you , Unless ye are converted and become as little children , ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , * he * is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name , receives me . <EOV> <SOV> But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me , it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to the world because of offences ! For it must needs be that offences come ; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes ! <EOV> <SOV> And if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut it off and cast [ it ] from thee ; it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed , [ rather ] than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire . <EOV> <SOV> And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out and cast [ it ] from thee ; it is good for thee to enter into life one - eyed , [ rather ] than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire . <EOV> <SOV> See that ye do not despise one of these little ones ; for I say unto you that their angels in [ the ] heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in [ the ] heavens . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man has come to save that which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> What think ye ? If a certain man should have a hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , does he not , leaving the ninety and nine on the mountains , go and seek the one that has gone astray ? <EOV> <SOV> And if it should come to pass that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoices more because of it than because of the ninety and nine not gone astray . <EOV> <SOV> So it is not the will of your Father who is in [ the ] heavens that one of these little ones should perish . <EOV> <SOV> But if thy brother sin against thee , go , reprove him between thee and him alone . If he hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother . <EOV> <SOV> But if he do not hear [ thee ] , take with thee one or two besides , that every matter may stand upon the word of two witnesses or of three . <EOV> <SOV> But if he will not listen to them , tell it to the assembly ; and if also he will not listen to the assembly , let him be to thee as one of the nations and a tax - gatherer . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven , and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Again I say to you , that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter , whatsoever it may be that they shall ask , it shall come to them from my Father who is in [ the ] heavens . <EOV> <SOV> For where two or three are gathered together unto my name , there am I in the midst of them . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter came to him and said , Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him ? until seven times ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , I say not to thee until seven times , but until seventy times seven . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who would reckon with his bondmen . <EOV> <SOV> And having begun to reckon , one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him . <EOV> <SOV> But he not having anything to pay , [ his ] lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and his children , and everything that he had , and that payment should be made . <EOV> <SOV> The bondman therefore falling down did him homage , saying , Lord , have patience with me and I will pay thee all . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord of that bondman , being moved with compassion , loosed him and forgave him the loan . <EOV> <SOV> But that bondman having gone out , found one of his fellow - bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii . And having seized him , he throttled him , saying , Pay [ me ] if thou owest anything . <EOV> <SOV> His fellow - bondman therefore , having fallen down [ at his feet ] , besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he would not , but went away and cast him into prison , until he should pay what was owing . <EOV> <SOV> But his fellow - bondmen , having seen what had taken place , were greatly grieved , and went and recounted to their lord all that had taken place . <EOV> <SOV> Then his lord , having called him to [ him ] , says to him , Wicked bondman ! I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me ; <EOV> <SOV> shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow - bondman , as * I * also had compassion on thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormentors till he paid all that was owing to him . <EOV> <SOV> Thus also my heavenly Father shall do to you if ye forgive not from your hearts every one his brother . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these words , he withdrew from Galilee , and came to the coasts of Judaea beyond the Jordan ; <EOV> <SOV> and great crowds followed him , and he healed them there . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees came to him tempting him , and saying , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said [ to them ] , Have ye not read that he who made [ them ] , from the beginning made them male and female , <EOV> <SOV> and said , On account of this a man shall leave father and mother , and shall be united to his wife , and the two shall be one flesh ? <EOV> <SOV> so that they are no longer two , but one flesh . What therefore God has joined together , let not man separate . <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [ her ] away ? <EOV> <SOV> He says to them , Moses , in view of your hardheartedness , allowed you to put away your wives ; but from the beginning it was not thus . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , that whosoever shall put away his wife , not for fornication , and shall marry another , commits adultery ; and he who marries one put away commits adultery . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say to him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , All can not receive this word , but those to whom it has been given ; <EOV> <SOV> for there are eunuchs which have been born thus from [ their ] mother 's womb ; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs of men ; and there are eunuchs who have made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens . He that is able to receive [ it ] , let him receive [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> Then there were brought to him little children that he might lay his hands on them and pray ; but the disciples rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Suffer little children , and do not hinder them from coming to me ; for the kingdom of the heavens is of such : <EOV> <SOV> and having laid his hands upon them , he departed thence . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , one coming up said to him , Teacher , what good thing shall I do that I may have life eternal ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , What askest thou me concerning goodness ? one is good . But if thou wouldest enter into life , keep the commandments . <EOV> <SOV> He says to him , Which ? And Jesus said , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness , <EOV> <SOV> Honour thy father and thy mother , and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> The young man says to him , All these have I kept ; what lack I yet ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , If thou wouldest be perfect , go , sell what thou hast and give to [ the ] poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> But the young man , having heard the word , went away grieved , for he had large possessions . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to his disciples , Verily I say unto you , A rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> and again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to enter a needle 's eye than a rich man into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples heard [ it ] they were exceedingly astonished , saying , Who then can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , looking on [ them ] , said to them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter answering said to him , Behold , * we * have left all things and have followed thee ; what then shall happen to us ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Verily I say unto you , That * ye * who have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit down upon his throne of glory , * ye * also shall sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And every one who has left houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive a hundredfold , and shall inherit life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> But many first shall be last , and last first . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> For the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who went out with the early morn to hire workmen for his vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day , he sent them into his vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And having gone out about [ the ] third hour , he saw others standing in the market - place idle ; <EOV> <SOV> and to them he said , Go also ye into the vineyard , and whatsoever may be just I will give you . And they went their way . <EOV> <SOV> Again , having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour , he did likewise . <EOV> <SOV> But about the eleventh [ hour ] , having gone out , he found others standing , and says to them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Because no man has hired us . He says to them , Go also ye into the vineyard [ and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive ] . <EOV> <SOV> But when the evening was come , the lord of the vineyard says to his steward , Call the workmen and pay [ them ] their wages , beginning from the last even to the first . <EOV> <SOV> And when they [ who came to work ] about the eleventh hour came , they received each a denarius . <EOV> <SOV> And when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more , and they received also themselves each a denarius . <EOV> <SOV> And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house , <EOV> <SOV> saying , These last have worked one hour , and thou hast made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the heat . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to one of them , [ My ] friend , I do not wrong thee . Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius ? <EOV> <SOV> Take what is thine and go . But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee : <EOV> <SOV> is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs ? Is thine eye evil because * I * am good ? <EOV> <SOV> Thus shall the last be first , and the first last ; for many are called ones , but few chosen ones . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , going up to Jerusalem , took the twelve disciples with [ him ] apart in the way , and said to them , <EOV> <SOV> Behold we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes , and they will condemn him to death ; <EOV> <SOV> and they will deliver him up to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify , and the third day he shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , doing homage , and asking something of him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , What wilt thou ? She says to him , Speak [ the word ] that these my two sons may sit , one on thy right hand and one on thy left in thy kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , Ye know not what ye ask . Can ye drink the cup which * I * am about to drink ? They say to him , We are able . <EOV> <SOV> [ And ] he says to them , Ye shall drink indeed my cup , but to sit on my right hand and on [ my ] left , is not mine to give , but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father . <EOV> <SOV> And the ten , having heard [ of it ] , were indignant about the two brothers . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus having called them to [ him ] , said , Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them , and the great exercise authority over them . <EOV> <SOV> It shall not be thus amongst you , but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your servant ; <EOV> <SOV> and whosoever will be first among you , let him be your bondman ; <EOV> <SOV> as indeed the Son of man did not come to be served , but to serve , and to give his life a ransom for many . <EOV> <SOV> And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , two blind men , sitting by the wayside , having heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out saying , Have mercy on us , Lord , Son of David . <EOV> <SOV> But the crowd rebuked them , that they might be silent . But they cried out the more , saying , Have mercy on us , Lord , Son of David . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having stopped , called them and said , What will ye that I shall do to you ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and immediately their eyes had sight restored to them , and they followed him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage , at the mount of Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying to them , Go into the village over against you , and immediately ye will find an ass tied , and a colt with it ; loose [ them ] and lead [ them ] to me . <EOV> <SOV> And if any one say anything to you , ye shall say , The Lord has need of them , and straightway he will send them . <EOV> <SOV> But all this came to pass , that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Say to the daughter of Zion , Behold thy King cometh to thee , meek , and mounted upon an ass , and upon a colt the foal of an ass . <EOV> <SOV> But the disciples , having gone and done as Jesus had ordered them , <EOV> <SOV> brought the ass and the colt and put their garments upon them , and he sat on them . <EOV> <SOV> But a very great crowd strewed their own garments on the way , and others kept cutting down branches from the trees and strewing them on the way . <EOV> <SOV> And the crowds who went before him and who followed cried , saying , Hosanna to the Son of David ; blessed [ be ] he who comes in the name of [ the ] Lord ; hosanna in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And as he entered into Jerusalem , the whole city was moved , saying , Who is this ? <EOV> <SOV> And the crowds said , This is Jesus the prophet who is from Nazareth of Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus entered into the temple [ of God ] , and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money - changers and the seats of those that sold the doves . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , It is written , My house shall be called a house of prayer , but * ye * have made it a den of robbers . <EOV> <SOV> And blind and lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders which he wrought , and the children crying in the temple and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David , they were indignant , <EOV> <SOV> and said to him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus says to them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ? <EOV> <SOV> And leaving them he went forth out of the city to Bethany , and there he passed the night . <EOV> <SOV> But early in the morning , as he came back into the city , he hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing one fig - tree in the way , he came to it and found on it nothing but leaves only . And he says to it , Let there be never more fruit of thee for ever . And the fig - tree was immediately dried up . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples saw [ it ] , they wondered , saying , How immediately is the fig - tree dried up ! <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and do not doubt , not only shall ye do what [ is done ] to the fig - tree , but even if ye should say to this mountain , Be thou taken away and be thou cast into the sea , it shall come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him [ as he was ] teaching , saying , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , * I * also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , * I * also will tell you by what authority I do these things : <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , whence was it ? of heaven or of men ? And they reasoned among themselves , saying , If we should say , Of heaven , he will say to us , Why then have ye not believed him ? <EOV> <SOV> but if we should say , Of men , we fear the crowd , for all hold John for a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And answering Jesus they said , We do not know . * He * also said to them , Neither do * I * tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> But what think ye ? A man had two children , and coming to the first he said , Child , go to - day , work in [ my ] vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , I will not ; but afterwards repenting himself he went . <EOV> <SOV> And coming to the second he said likewise ; and he answering said , * I * [ go ] , sir , and went not . <EOV> <SOV> Which of the two did the will of the father ? They say [ to him ] , The first . Jesus says to them , Verily I say unto you that the tax - gatherers and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you . <EOV> <SOV> For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not ; but the tax - gatherers and the harlots believed him ; but * ye * when ye saw [ it ] repented not yourselves afterwards to believe him . <EOV> <SOV> Hear another parable : There was a householder who planted a vineyard , and made a fence round it , and dug a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and left the country . <EOV> <SOV> But when the time of fruit drew near , he sent his bondmen to the husbandmen to receive his fruits . <EOV> <SOV> And the husbandmen took his bondmen , and beat one , killed another , and stoned another . <EOV> <SOV> Again he sent other bondmen more than the first , and they did to them in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> And at last he sent to them his son , saying , They will have respect for my son . <EOV> <SOV> But the husbandmen , seeing the son , said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him and possess his inheritance . <EOV> <SOV> And they took him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes , what shall he do to those husbandmen ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , He will miserably destroy those evil [ men ] , and let out the vineyard to other husbandmen , who shall render him the fruits in their seasons . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to them , Have ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner - stone : this is of [ the ] Lord , and it is wonderful in our eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I say to you , that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it . <EOV> <SOV> And he that falls on this stone shall be broken , but on whomsoever it shall fall , it shall grind him to powder . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the Pharisees , having heard his parables , knew that he spoke about them . <EOV> <SOV> And seeking to lay hold of him , they were afraid of the crowds , because they held him for a prophet . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus answering spoke to them again in parables , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who made a wedding feast for his son , <EOV> <SOV> and sent his bondmen to call the persons invited to the wedding feast , and they would not come . <EOV> <SOV> Again he sent other bondmen , saying , Say to the persons invited , Behold , I have prepared my dinner ; my oxen and my fatted beasts are killed , and all things ready ; come to the wedding feast . <EOV> <SOV> But they made light of it , and went , one to his own land , and another to his commerce . <EOV> <SOV> And the rest , laying hold of his bondmen , ill - treated and slew [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> And [ when ] the king [ heard of it he ] was wroth , and having sent his forces , destroyed those murderers and burned their city . <EOV> <SOV> Then he says to his bondmen , The wedding feast is ready , but those invited were not worthy ; <EOV> <SOV> go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways , and as many as ye shall find invite to the wedding feast . <EOV> <SOV> And those bondmen went out into the highways , and brought together all as many as they found , both evil and good ; and the wedding feast was furnished with guests . <EOV> <SOV> And the king , having gone in to see the guests , beheld there a man not clothed with a wedding garment . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to him , [ My ] friend , how camest thou in here not having on a wedding garment ? But he was speechless . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the king to the servants , Bind him feet and hands , and take him away , and cast him out into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> For many are called ones , but few chosen ones . <EOV> <SOV> Then went the Pharisees and held a council how they might ensnare him in speaking . <EOV> <SOV> And they send out to him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , Teacher , we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth , and carest not for any one , for thou regardest not men 's person ; <EOV> <SOV> tell us therefore what thou thinkest : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , knowing their wickedness , said , Why tempt ye me , hypocrites ? <EOV> <SOV> Shew me the money of the tribute . And they presented to him a denarius . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Whose [ is ] this image and superscription ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Caesar 's . Then he says to them , Pay then what is Caesar 's to Caesar , and what is God 's to God . <EOV> <SOV> And when they heard [ him ] , they wondered , and left him , and went away . <EOV> <SOV> On that day came to him Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and they demanded of him , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Teacher , Moses said , If any one die , not having children , his brother shall marry his wife and shall raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were with us seven brethren ; and the first having married died , and not having seed , left his wife to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> In like manner also the second and the third , unto the seven . <EOV> <SOV> And last of all the woman also died . <EOV> <SOV> In the resurrection therefore of which of the seven shall she be wife , for all had her ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Ye err , not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but are as angels of God in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But concerning the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read what was spoken to you by God , saying , <EOV> <SOV> * I * am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not God of [ the ] dead , but of [ the ] living . <EOV> <SOV> And when the crowds heard [ it ] they were astonished at his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees , having heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , were gathered together . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , a lawyer , demanded , tempting him , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Thou shalt love [ the ] Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy understanding . <EOV> <SOV> This is [ the ] great and first commandment . <EOV> <SOV> And [ the ] second is like it , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees being gathered together , Jesus demanded of them , <EOV> <SOV> saying , What think ye concerning the Christ ? whose son is he ? They say to him , David 's . <EOV> <SOV> He says to them , How then does David in Spirit call him Lord , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The Lord said to my Lord , Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies under thy feet ? <EOV> <SOV> If therefore David call him Lord , how is he his son ? <EOV> <SOV> And no one was able to answer him a word , nor did any one dare from that day to question him any more . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying , The scribes and the Pharisees have set themselves down in Moses ' seat : <EOV> <SOV> all things therefore , whatever they may tell you , do and keep . But do not after their works , for they say and do not , <EOV> <SOV> but bind burdens heavy and hard to bear , and lay them on the shoulders of men , but will not move them with their finger . <EOV> <SOV> And all their works they do to be seen of men : for they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders [ of their garments ] , <EOV> <SOV> and love the chief place in feasts and the first seats in the synagogues , <EOV> <SOV> and salutations in the market - places , and to be called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi . <EOV> <SOV> But * ye * , be not ye called Rabbi ; for one is your instructor , and all * ye * are brethren . <EOV> <SOV> And call not [ any one ] your father upon the earth ; for one is your Father , he who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Neither be called instructors , for one is your instructor , the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> But the greatest of you shall be your servant . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled , and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men ; for * ye * do not enter , nor do ye suffer those that are entering to go in . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye compass the sea and the dry [ land ] to make one proselyte , and when he is become [ such ] , ye make him twofold more [ the ] son of hell than yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , blind guides , who say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor . <EOV> <SOV> Fools and blind , for which is greater , the gold , or the temple which sanctifies the gold ? <EOV> <SOV> And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it is a debtor . <EOV> <SOV> [ Fools and ] blind ones , for which is greater , the gift , or the altar which sanctifies the gift ? <EOV> <SOV> He therefore that swears by the altar swears by it and by all things that are upon it . <EOV> <SOV> And he that swears by the temple swears by it and by him that dwells in it . <EOV> <SOV> And he that swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him that sits upon it . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin , and ye have left aside the weightier matters of the law , judgment and mercy and faith : these ye ought to have done and not have left those aside . <EOV> <SOV> Blind guides , who strain out the gnat , but drink down the camel . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish , but within they are full of rapine and intemperance . <EOV> <SOV> Blind Pharisee , make clean first the inside of the cup and of the dish , that their outside also may become clean . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye are like whited sepulchres , which appear beautiful outwardly , but within are full of dead men 's bones and all uncleanness . <EOV> <SOV> Thus also * ye * , outwardly ye appear righteous to men , but within are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the just , <EOV> <SOV> and ye say , If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> So that ye bear witness of yourselves that ye are sons of those who slew the prophets : <EOV> <SOV> and * ye * , fill ye up the measure of your fathers . <EOV> <SOV> Serpents , offspring of vipers , how should ye escape the judgment of hell ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore , behold , * I * send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes ; and [ some ] of them ye will kill and crucify , and [ some ] of them ye will scourge in your synagogues , and will persecute from city to city ; <EOV> <SOV> so that all righteous blood shed upon the earth should come upon * you * , from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation . <EOV> <SOV> Jerusalem , Jerusalem , [ the city ] that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her , how often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , and ye would not ! <EOV> <SOV> Behold , your house is left unto you desolate ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say unto you , Ye shall in no wise see me henceforth until ye say , Blessed [ be ] he that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus went forth and went away from the temple , and his disciples came to [ him ] to point out to him the buildings of the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , Do ye not see all these things ? Verily I say to you , Not a stone shall be left here upon a stone which shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was sitting upon the mount of Olives the disciples came to him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be , and what is the sign of thy coming and [ the ] completion of the age ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , See that no one mislead you . <EOV> <SOV> For many shall come in my name , saying , * I * am the Christ , and they shall mislead many . <EOV> <SOV> But ye will hear of wars and rumours of wars . See that ye be not disturbed ; for all [ these things ] must take place , but it is not yet the end . <EOV> <SOV> For nation shall rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be famines and pestilences , and earthquakes in divers places . <EOV> <SOV> But all these [ are the ] beginning of throes . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall they deliver you up to tribulation , and shall kill you ; and ye will be hated of all the nations for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> And then will many be offended , and will deliver one another up , and hate one another ; <EOV> <SOV> and many false prophets shall arise and shall mislead many ; <EOV> <SOV> and because lawlessness shall prevail , the love of the most shall grow cold ; <EOV> <SOV> but he that has endured to the end , * he * shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> And these glad tidings of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole habitable earth , for a witness to all the nations , and then shall come the end . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation , which is spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in [ what is a ] holy place , ( he that reads let him understand , ) <EOV> <SOV> then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; <EOV> <SOV> let not him that is on the house come down to take the things out of his house ; <EOV> <SOV> and let not him that is in the field turn back to take his garment . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to those that are with child , and those that give suck in those days . <EOV> <SOV> But pray that your flight may not be in winter time nor on sabbath : <EOV> <SOV> for then shall there be great tribulation , such as has not been from [ the ] beginning of [ the ] world until now , nor ever shall be ; <EOV> <SOV> and if those days had not been cut short , no flesh had been saved ; but on account of the elect those days shall be cut short . <EOV> <SOV> Then if any one say to you , Behold , here is the Christ , or here , believe [ it ] not . <EOV> <SOV> For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall give great signs and wonders , so as to mislead , if possible , even the elect . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I have told you beforehand . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore they say to you , Behold , he is in the desert , go not forth ; behold , [ he is ] in the inner chambers , do not believe [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> For as the lightning goes forth from the east and shines to the west , so shall be the coming of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> [ For ] wherever the carcase is , there will be gathered the eagles . <EOV> <SOV> But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened , and the moon not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven ; and then shall all the tribes of the land lament , and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> And he shall send his angels with a great sound of trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from [ the one ] extremity of [ the ] heavens to [ the other ] extremity of them . <EOV> <SOV> But learn the parable from the fig - tree : When already its branch becomes tender and produces leaves , ye know that the summer is near . <EOV> <SOV> Thus also * ye * , when ye see all these things , know that it is near , at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , This generation will not have passed away until all these things shall have taken place . <EOV> <SOV> The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall in no wise pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But of that day and hour no one knows , not even the angels of the heavens , but [ my ] Father alone . <EOV> <SOV> But as the days of Noe , so also shall be the coming of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> For as they were in the days which were before the flood , eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day on which Noe entered into the ark , <EOV> <SOV> and they knew not till the flood came and took all away ; thus also shall be the coming of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Then two shall be in the field , one is taken and one is left ; <EOV> <SOV> two [ women ] grinding at the mill , one is taken and one is left . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore , for ye know not in what hour your Lord comes . <EOV> <SOV> But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be dug through [ into ] . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore * ye * also , be ye ready , for in that hour that ye think not the Son of man comes . <EOV> <SOV> Who then is the faithful and prudent bondman whom his lord has set over his household , to give them food in season ? <EOV> <SOV> Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , that he will set him over all his substance . <EOV> <SOV> But if that evil bondman should say in his heart , My lord delays to come , <EOV> <SOV> and begin to beat his fellow - bondmen , and eat and drink with the drunken ; <EOV> <SOV> the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does not expect it , and in an hour he knows not of , <EOV> <SOV> and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be made like to ten virgins that having taken their torches , went forth to meet the bridegroom . <EOV> <SOV> And five of them were prudent and five foolish . <EOV> <SOV> They that were foolish took their torches and did not take oil with them ; <EOV> <SOV> but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their torches . <EOV> <SOV> Now the bridegroom tarrying , they all grew heavy and slept . <EOV> <SOV> But in [ the ] middle of [ the ] night there was a cry , Behold , the bridegroom ; go forth to meet him . <EOV> <SOV> Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their torches . <EOV> <SOV> And the foolish said to the prudent , Give us of your oil , for our torches are going out . <EOV> <SOV> But the prudent answered saying , [ We can not , ] lest it might not suffice for us and for you . Go rather to those that sell , and buy for yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> But as they went away to buy , the bridegroom came , and the [ ones that were ] ready went in with him to the wedding feast , and the door was shut . <EOV> <SOV> Afterwards come also the rest of the virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us ; <EOV> <SOV> but he answering said , Verily I say unto you , I do not know you . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore , for ye know not the day nor the hour . <EOV> <SOV> For [ it is ] as [ if ] a man going away out of a country called his own bondmen and delivered to them his substance . <EOV> <SOV> And to one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to each according to his particular ability , and immediately went away out of the country . <EOV> <SOV> And he that had received the five talents went and trafficked with them , and made five other talents . <EOV> <SOV> In like manner also he that [ had received ] the two , [ he also ] gained two others . <EOV> <SOV> But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth , and hid the money of his lord . <EOV> <SOV> And after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes and reckons with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he that had received the five talents came to [ him ] and brought five other talents , saying , [ My ] lord , thou deliveredst me five talents ; behold , I have gained five other talents besides them . <EOV> <SOV> His lord said to him , Well , good and faithful bondman , thou wast faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things : enter into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he also that had received the two talents came to [ him ] and said , [ My ] lord , thou deliveredst me two talents ; behold , I have gained two other talents besides them . <EOV> <SOV> His lord said to him , Well , good and faithful bondman , thou wast faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he also that had received the one talent coming to [ him ] said , [ My ] lord , I knew thee that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou hadst not sowed , and gathering from where thou hadst not scattered , <EOV> <SOV> and being afraid I went away and hid thy talent in the earth ; behold , thou hast that which is thine . <EOV> <SOV> And his lord answering said to him , Wicked and slothful bondman , thou knewest that I reap where I had not sowed , and gather from where I had not scattered ; <EOV> <SOV> thou oughtest then to have put my money to the money - changers , and when I came I should have got what is mine with interest . <EOV> <SOV> Take therefore the talent from him , and give it to him that has the ten talents : <EOV> <SOV> for to every one that has shall be given , and he shall be in abundance ; but from him that has not , that even which he has shall be taken from him . <EOV> <SOV> And cast out the useless bondman into the outer darkness ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Son of man comes in his glory , and all the angels with him , then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory , <EOV> <SOV> and all the nations shall be gathered before him ; and he shall separate them from one another , as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats ; <EOV> <SOV> and he will set the sheep on his right hand , and the goats on [ his ] left . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall the King say to those on his right hand , Come , blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from [ the ] world 's foundation : <EOV> <SOV> for I hungered , and ye gave me to eat ; I thirsted , and ye gave me to drink ; I was a stranger , and ye took me in ; <EOV> <SOV> naked , and ye clothed me ; I was ill , and ye visited me ; I was in prison , and ye came to me . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall the righteous answer him saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungering , and nourished thee ; or thirsting , and gave thee to drink ? <EOV> <SOV> and when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ; or naked , and clothed thee ? <EOV> <SOV> and when saw we thee ill , or in prison , and came to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And the King answering shall say to them , Verily , I say to you , Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it to me . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall he say also to those on the left , Go from me , cursed , into eternal fire , prepared for the devil and his angels : <EOV> <SOV> for I hungered , and ye gave me not to eat ; I thirsted , and ye gave me not to drink ; <EOV> <SOV> I was a stranger , and ye took me not in ; naked , and ye did not clothe me ; ill , and in prison , and ye did not visit me . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall * they * also answer saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungering , or thirsting , or a stranger , or naked , or ill , or in prison , and have not ministered to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Then shall he answer them saying , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least , neither have ye done it to me . <EOV> <SOV> And these shall go away into eternal punishment , and the righteous into life eternal . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Ye know that after two days the passover takes place , and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas , <EOV> <SOV> and took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by subtlety and kill him ; <EOV> <SOV> but they said , Not in the feast , that there be not a tumult among the people . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus being in Bethany , in Simon the leper 's house , <EOV> <SOV> a woman , having an alabaster flask of very precious ointment , came to him and poured it out upon his head as he lay at table . <EOV> <SOV> But the disciples seeing it became indignant , saying , To what end [ was ] this waste ? <EOV> <SOV> for this might have been sold for much and been given to the poor . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus knowing [ it ] said to them , Why do ye trouble the woman ? for she has wrought a good work toward me . <EOV> <SOV> For ye have the poor always with you , but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> For in pouring out this ointment on my body , she has done it for my burying . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world , that also which this [ woman ] has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her . <EOV> <SOV> Then one of the twelve , he who was called Judas Iscariote , went to the chief priests <EOV> <SOV> and said , What are ye willing to give me , and * I * will deliver him up to you ? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver . <EOV> <SOV> And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up . <EOV> <SOV> Now on the first [ day ] of [ the feast of ] unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Go into the city unto such a one , and say to him , The Teacher says , My time is near , I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them , and they prepared the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating he said , Verily I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up . <EOV> <SOV> And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him , each of them , Is it * I * , Lord ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , He that dips his hand with me in the dish , * he * it is who shall deliver me up . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man goes indeed , according as it is written concerning him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up ; it were good for that man if he had not been born . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas , who delivered him up , answering said , Is it * I * , Rabbi ? He says to him , * Thou * hast said . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating , Jesus , having taken [ the ] bread and blessed , broke [ it ] and gave [ it ] to the disciples , and said , Take , eat : this is my body . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken [ the ] cup and given thanks , he gave [ it ] to them , saying , Drink ye all of it . <EOV> <SOV> For this is my blood , that of the [ new ] covenant , that shed for many for remission of sins . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father . <EOV> <SOV> And having sung a hymn , they went out to the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus to them , All * ye * shall be offended in me during this night . For it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> But after that I shall be risen , I will go before you to Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering said to him , If all shall be offended in thee , * I * will never be offended . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , Verily I say to thee , that during this night , before [ the ] cock shall crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> Peter says to him , If I should needs die with thee , I will in no wise deny thee . Likewise said all the disciples also . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane , and says to the disciples , Sit here until I go away and pray yonder . <EOV> <SOV> And taking with [ him ] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed . <EOV> <SOV> Then he says to them , My soul is very sorrowful even unto death ; remain here and watch with me . <EOV> <SOV> And going forward a little he fell upon his face , praying and saying , My Father , if it be possible let this cup pass from me ; but not as * I * will , but as * thou * [ wilt ] . <EOV> <SOV> And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping , and says to Peter , Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me ? <EOV> <SOV> Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed [ is ] ready , but the flesh weak . <EOV> <SOV> Again going away a second time he prayed saying , My Father , if this can not pass [ from me ] unless I drink it , thy will be done . <EOV> <SOV> And coming he found them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy . <EOV> <SOV> And leaving them , he went away again and prayed the third time , saying the same thing . <EOV> <SOV> Then he comes to the disciples and says to them , Sleep on now and take your rest ; behold , the hour has drawn nigh , and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Arise , let us go ; behold , he that delivers me up has drawn nigh . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was yet speaking , behold , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people . <EOV> <SOV> Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , he it is : seize him . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately coming up to Jesus he said , Hail , Rabbi , and covered him with kisses . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , [ My ] friend , for what purpose art thou come ? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword , and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus to him , Return thy sword to its place ; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword . <EOV> <SOV> Or thinkest thou that I can not now call upon my Father , and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels ? <EOV> <SOV> How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be ? <EOV> <SOV> In that hour Jesus said to the crowds , Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me ? I sat daily [ with you ] teaching in the temple , and ye did not seize me . <EOV> <SOV> But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled . Then all the disciples left him and fled . <EOV> <SOV> Now they that had seized Jesus led [ him ] away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter followed him at a distance , even to the palace of the high priest , and entering in sat with the officers to see the end . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus , so that they might put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> And they found none , though many false witnesses came forward . But at the last two false witnesses came forward <EOV> <SOV> and said , * He * said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and in three days build it . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest standing up said to him , Answerest thou nothing ? What do these witness against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus was silent . And the high priest answering said to him , I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if * thou * art the Christ the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , * Thou * hast said . Moreover , I say to you , From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power , and coming on the clouds of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He has blasphemed : what need have we any more of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard the blasphemy . <EOV> <SOV> What think ye ? And they answering said , He is liable to the penalty of death . <EOV> <SOV> Then they spit in his face , and buffeted him , and some struck him with the palms of their hand , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Prophesy to us , Christ , Who is it who struck thee ? <EOV> <SOV> But Peter sat without in the palace - court ; and a maid came to him , saying , And * thou * wast with Jesus the Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied before all , saying , I do not know what thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had gone out into the entrance , another [ maid ] saw him , and says to those there , This [ man ] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean . <EOV> <SOV> And again he denied with an oath : I do not know the man . <EOV> <SOV> And after a little , those who stood [ there ] , coming to [ him ] , said to Peter , Truly * thou * too art of them , for also thy speech makes thee manifest . <EOV> <SOV> Then he began to curse and to swear , I know not the man . And immediately [ the ] cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , who had said [ to him ] , Before [ the ] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went forth without , and wept bitterly . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when it was morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so that they might put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> And having bound him they led him away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor . <EOV> <SOV> Then Judas , who delivered him up , seeing that he had been condemned , filled with remorse , returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders , <EOV> <SOV> saying , I have sinned [ in ] having delivered up guiltless blood . But they said , What is that to us ? see * thou * [ to that ] . <EOV> <SOV> And having cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , he left the place , and went away and hanged himself . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said , It is not lawful to cast them into the Corban , since it is [ the ] price of blood . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken counsel , they bought with them the field of the potter for a burying - ground for strangers . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore that field has been called Blood - field unto this day . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet , saying , And I took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was set a price on , whom [ they who were ] of the sons of Israel had set a price on , <EOV> <SOV> and they gave them for the field of the potter , according as [ the ] Lord commanded me . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus stood before the governor . And the governor questioned him , saying , Art * thou * the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said to him , Thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders , he answered nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Then says Pilate to him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered him not so much as one word , so that the governor wondered exceedingly . <EOV> <SOV> Now at [ the ] feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd , whom they would . <EOV> <SOV> And they had then a notable prisoner , named Barabbas . <EOV> <SOV> They therefore being gathered together , Pilate said to them , Whom will ye that I release to you , Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy . <EOV> <SOV> But , as he was sitting on the judgment - seat , his wife sent to him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that righteous [ man ] ; for I have suffered to - day many things in a dream because of him . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should beg for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And the governor answering said to them , Which of the two will ye that I release unto you ? And they said , Barabbas . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate says to them , What then shall I do with Jesus , who is called Christ ? They all say , Let him be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And the governor said , What evil then has he done ? But they cried more than ever , saying , Let him be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate , seeing that it availed nothing , but that rather a tumult was arising , having taken water , washed his hands before the crowd , saying , I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one : see * ye * [ to it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people answering said , His blood [ be ] on us and on our children . <EOV> <SOV> Then he released to them Barabbas ; but Jesus , having scourged [ him ] , he delivered up that he might be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> Then the soldiers of the governor , having taken Jesus with [ them ] to the praetorium , gathered against him the whole band , <EOV> <SOV> and having taken off his garment , put on him a scarlet cloak ; <EOV> <SOV> and having woven a crown out of thorns , they put it on his head , and a reed in his right hand ; and , bowing the knee before him , they mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews ! <EOV> <SOV> And having spit upon him , they took the reed and beat [ him ] on his head . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had mocked him , they took the cloak off him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him away to crucify . <EOV> <SOV> And as they went forth they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name ; him they compelled to go [ with them ] that he might bear his cross . <EOV> <SOV> And having come to a place called Golgotha , which means Place of a skull , <EOV> <SOV> they gave to him to drink vinegar mingled with gall ; and having tasted [ it ] , he would not drink . <EOV> <SOV> And having crucified him , they parted his clothes amongst [ themselves ] , casting lots . <EOV> <SOV> And sitting down , they kept guard over him there . <EOV> <SOV> And they set up over his head his accusation written : This is Jesus , the King of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Then are crucified with him two robbers , one on the right hand and one on the left . <EOV> <SOV> But the passers - by reviled him , shaking their heads <EOV> <SOV> and saying , Thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days , save thyself . If thou art Son of God , descend from the cross . <EOV> <SOV> [ And ] in like manner the chief priests also , mocking , with the scribes and elders , said , <EOV> <SOV> He saved others , himself he can not save . He is King of Israel : let him descend now from the cross , and we will believe on him . <EOV> <SOV> He trusted upon God ; let him save him now if he will [ have ] him . For he said , I am Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the robbers also who had been crucified with him cast the same reproaches on him . <EOV> <SOV> Now from [ the ] sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until [ the ] ninth hour ; <EOV> <SOV> but about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? <EOV> <SOV> And some of those who stood there , when they heard [ it ] , said , This [ man ] calls for Elias . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately one of them running and getting a sponge , having filled [ it ] with vinegar and fixed [ it ] on a reed , gave him to drink . <EOV> <SOV> But the rest said , Let be ; let us see if Elias comes to save him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having again cried with a loud voice , gave up the ghost . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom , and the earth was shaken , and the rocks were rent , <EOV> <SOV> and the tombs were opened ; and many bodies of the saints fallen asleep arose , <EOV> <SOV> and going out of the tombs after his arising , entered into the holy city and appeared unto many . <EOV> <SOV> But the centurion , and they who were with him on guard over Jesus , seeing the earthquake and the things that took place , feared greatly , saying , Truly this [ man ] was Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And there were there many women beholding from afar off , who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to him , <EOV> <SOV> among whom was Mary of Magdala , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee . <EOV> <SOV> Now when even was come there came a rich man of Arimathaea , his name Joseph , who also himself was a disciple to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> * He * , going to Pilate , begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph having got the body , wrapped it in a clean linen cloth , <EOV> <SOV> and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn in the rock ; and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , went away . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary of Magdala was there , and the other Mary , sitting opposite the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> Now on the morrow , which is after the preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Sir , we have called to mind that that deceiver said when he was still alive , After three days I arise . <EOV> <SOV> Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured until the third day , lest his disciples should come and steal him away , and say to the people , He is risen from the dead ; and the last error shall be worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said to them , Ye have a watch : go , secure it as well as ye know how . <EOV> <SOV> And they went and secured the sepulchre , having sealed the stone , with the watch [ besides ] . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now late on sabbath , as it was the dusk of the next day after sabbath , came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a great earthquake ; for an angel of [ the ] Lord , descending out of heaven , came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it . <EOV> <SOV> And his look was as lightning , and his clothing white as snow . <EOV> <SOV> And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answering said to the women , Fear not * ye * , for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one . <EOV> <SOV> He is not here , for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay . <EOV> <SOV> And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and behold , he goes before you into Galilee , there shall ye see him . Behold , I have told you . <EOV> <SOV> And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , they ran to bring his disciples word . <EOV> <SOV> And as they went to bring his disciples word , behold also , Jesus met them , saying , Hail ! And they coming up took him by the feet , and did him homage . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus says to them , Fear not ; go , bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee , and there they shall see me . <EOV> <SOV> And as they went , behold , some of the watch went into the city , and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place . <EOV> <SOV> And having assembled with the elders , and having taken counsel , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Say that his disciples coming by night stole him [ while ] we [ were ] sleeping . <EOV> <SOV> And if this should come to the hearing of the governor , * we * will persuade him , and save * you * from all anxiety . <EOV> <SOV> And they took the money and did as they had been taught . And this report is current among the Jews until this day . <EOV> <SOV> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him , they did homage to him : but some doubted . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus coming up spoke to them , saying , All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth . <EOV> <SOV> Go [ therefore ] and make disciples of all the nations , baptising them to the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you . And behold , * I * am with you all the days , until the completion of the age . <EOV> <EOC>
