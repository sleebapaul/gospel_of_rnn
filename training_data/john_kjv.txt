<SOC> <SOV> In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . <EOV> <SOV> The same was in the beginning with God . <EOV> <SOV> All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made . <EOV> <SOV> In him was life ; and the life was the light of men . <EOV> <SOV> And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not . <EOV> <SOV> There was a man sent from God , whose name was John . <EOV> <SOV> The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe . <EOV> <SOV> He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light . <EOV> <SOV> That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world . <EOV> <SOV> He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not . <EOV> <SOV> He came unto his own , and his own received him not . <EOV> <SOV> But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name : <EOV> <SOV> Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth . <EOV> <SOV> John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me . <EOV> <SOV> And of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace . <EOV> <SOV> For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ . <EOV> <SOV> No man hath seen God at any time , the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ? <EOV> <SOV> And he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , I am not the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou that prophet ? And he answered , No . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Esaias . <EOV> <SOV> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ? <EOV> <SOV> John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ; <EOV> <SOV> He it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe 's latchet I am not worthy to unloose . <EOV> <SOV> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing . <EOV> <SOV> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world . <EOV> <SOV> This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water . <EOV> <SOV> And John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost . <EOV> <SOV> And I saw , and bare record that this is the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> And looking upon Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God ! <EOV> <SOV> And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? They said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour . <EOV> <SOV> One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother . <EOV> <SOV> He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone . <EOV> <SOV> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith unto him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter . <EOV> <SOV> Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> And Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile ! <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael saith unto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee . <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael answered and saith unto him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there : <EOV> <SOV> And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage . <EOV> <SOV> And when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it . <EOV> <SOV> And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . And they bare it . <EOV> <SOV> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom , <EOV> <SOV> And saith unto him , Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now . <EOV> <SOV> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days . <EOV> <SOV> And the Jews ' passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting : <EOV> <SOV> And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ; <EOV> <SOV> And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house an house of merchandise . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples remembered that it was written , The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ? <EOV> <SOV> But he spake of the temple of his body . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men , <EOV> <SOV> And needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> There was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews : <EOV> <SOV> The same came to Jesus by night , and said unto him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born again . <EOV> <SOV> The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ? <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness . <EOV> <SOV> If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heavenly things ? <EOV> <SOV> And no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up : <EOV> <SOV> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . <EOV> <SOV> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved . <EOV> <SOV> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God . <EOV> <SOV> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized . <EOV> <SOV> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized . <EOV> <SOV> For John was not yet cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> Then there arose a question between some of John 's disciples and the Jews about purifying . <EOV> <SOV> And they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him . <EOV> <SOV> John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> He must increase , but I must decrease . <EOV> <SOV> He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all . <EOV> <SOV> And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true . <EOV> <SOV> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him . <EOV> <SOV> The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John , <EOV> <SOV> ( Though Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , ) <EOV> <SOV> He left Judaea , and departed again into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And he must needs go through Samaria . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour . <EOV> <SOV> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink . <EOV> <SOV> ( For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . ) <EOV> <SOV> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ? <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto her , Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again : <EOV> <SOV> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither . <EOV> <SOV> The woman answered and said , I have no husband . Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband : <EOV> <SOV> For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him . <EOV> <SOV> God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , I know that Messias cometh , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am he . <EOV> <SOV> And upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why talkest thou with her ? <EOV> <SOV> The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men , <EOV> <SOV> Come , see a man , which told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they went out of the city , and came unto him . <EOV> <SOV> In the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not of . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work . <EOV> <SOV> Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest . <EOV> <SOV> And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together . <EOV> <SOV> And herein is that saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth . <EOV> <SOV> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did . <EOV> <SOV> So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days . <EOV> <SOV> And many more believed because of his own word ; <EOV> <SOV> And said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country . <EOV> <SOV> Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast . <EOV> <SOV> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth . <EOV> <SOV> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . <EOV> <SOV> So the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house . <EOV> <SOV> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches . <EOV> <SOV> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water . <EOV> <SOV> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ? <EOV> <SOV> The impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Rise , take up thy bed , and walk . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured , It is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed . <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk . <EOV> <SOV> Then asked they him , What man is that which said unto thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> And he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place . <EOV> <SOV> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee . <EOV> <SOV> The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus , which had made him whole . <EOV> <SOV> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , and I work . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father , making himself equal with God . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise . <EOV> <SOV> For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel . <EOV> <SOV> For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will . <EOV> <SOV> For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son : <EOV> <SOV> That all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live . <EOV> <SOV> For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ; <EOV> <SOV> And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice , <EOV> <SOV> And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation . <EOV> <SOV> I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . <EOV> <SOV> There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true . <EOV> <SOV> Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth . <EOV> <SOV> But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved . <EOV> <SOV> He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light . <EOV> <SOV> But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape . <EOV> <SOV> And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not . <EOV> <SOV> Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life . <EOV> <SOV> I receive not honour from men . <EOV> <SOV> But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you . <EOV> <SOV> I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive . <EOV> <SOV> How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ? <EOV> <SOV> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust . <EOV> <SOV> For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me ; for he wrote of me . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias . <EOV> <SOV> And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ? <EOV> <SOV> And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do . <EOV> <SOV> Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little . <EOV> <SOV> One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , saith unto him , <EOV> <SOV> There is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would . <EOV> <SOV> When they were filled , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten . <EOV> <SOV> Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone . <EOV> <SOV> And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea , <EOV> <SOV> And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them . <EOV> <SOV> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew . <EOV> <SOV> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> Then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went . <EOV> <SOV> The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ; <EOV> <SOV> ( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : ) <EOV> <SOV> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled . <EOV> <SOV> Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath God the Father sealed . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we might work the works of God ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , What sign shewest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ? <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst . <EOV> <SOV> But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not . <EOV> <SOV> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out . <EOV> <SOV> For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews then murmured at him , because he said , I am the bread which came down from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me . <EOV> <SOV> Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life . <EOV> <SOV> I am that bread of life . <EOV> <SOV> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead . <EOV> <SOV> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die . <EOV> <SOV> I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you . <EOV> <SOV> Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed . <EOV> <SOV> He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me . <EOV> <SOV> This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever . <EOV> <SOV> These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ? <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , Doth this offend you ? <EOV> <SOV> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ? <EOV> <SOV> It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life . <EOV> <SOV> But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my Father . <EOV> <SOV> From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto the twelve , Will ye also go away ? <EOV> <SOV> Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ? <EOV> <SOV> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Jewry , because the Jews sought to kill him . <EOV> <SOV> Now the Jew 's feast of tabernacles was at hand . <EOV> <SOV> His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest . <EOV> <SOV> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world . <EOV> <SOV> For neither did his brethren believe in him . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said unto them , My time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready . <EOV> <SOV> The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil . <EOV> <SOV> Go ye up unto this feast : I go not up yet unto this feast : for my time is not yet full come . <EOV> <SOV> When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret . <EOV> <SOV> Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ? <EOV> <SOV> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people . <EOV> <SOV> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught . <EOV> <SOV> And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself . <EOV> <SOV> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him . <EOV> <SOV> Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ? <EOV> <SOV> The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel . <EOV> <SOV> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man . <EOV> <SOV> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment . <EOV> <SOV> Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he , whom they seek to kill ? <EOV> <SOV> But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not . <EOV> <SOV> But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ? <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ? <EOV> <SOV> What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come ? <EOV> <SOV> In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . <EOV> <SOV> ( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . ) <EOV> <SOV> Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , Of a truth this is the Prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ? <EOV> <SOV> Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ? <EOV> <SOV> So there was a division among the people because of him . <EOV> <SOV> And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why have ye not brought him ? <EOV> <SOV> The officers answered , Never man spake like this man . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered them the Pharisees , Are ye also deceived ? <EOV> <SOV> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ? <EOV> <SOV> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , ) <EOV> <SOV> Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And every man went unto his own house . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst , <EOV> <SOV> They say unto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act . <EOV> <SOV> Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not . <EOV> <SOV> So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her . <EOV> <SOV> And again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ? <EOV> <SOV> She said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said unto her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more . <EOV> <SOV> Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said unto him , Thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , Though I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye can not tell whence I come , and whither I go . <EOV> <SOV> Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man . <EOV> <SOV> And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true . <EOV> <SOV> I am one that bear witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they unto him , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor my Father : if ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also . <EOV> <SOV> These words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world . <EOV> <SOV> I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? And Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning . <EOV> <SOV> I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him . <EOV> <SOV> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him . <EOV> <SOV> As he spake these words , many believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him , If ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ; <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , We be Abraham 's seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the Son abideth ever . <EOV> <SOV> If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed . <EOV> <SOV> I know that ye are Abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you . <EOV> <SOV> I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Ye do the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye can not hear my word . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it . <EOV> <SOV> And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not . <EOV> <SOV> Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ? <EOV> <SOV> He that is of God heareth God 's words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered the Jews , and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a devil ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I have not a devil ; but I honour my Father , and ye do dishonour me . <EOV> <SOV> And I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death . <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God : <EOV> <SOV> Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying . <EOV> <SOV> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am . <EOV> <SOV> Then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as Jesus passed by , he saw a man which was blind from his birth . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him . <EOV> <SOV> I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work . <EOV> <SOV> As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world . <EOV> <SOV> When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay , <EOV> <SOV> And said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing . <EOV> <SOV> The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ? <EOV> <SOV> Some said , This is he : others said , He is like him : but he said , I am he . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said they unto him , How were thine eyes opened ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , A man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they unto him , Where is he ? He said , I know not . <EOV> <SOV> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes . <EOV> <SOV> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . He said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the sabbath day . Others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? And there was a division among them . <EOV> <SOV> They say unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? He said , He is a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> But the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked them , saying , Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ? <EOV> <SOV> His parents answered them and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind : <EOV> <SOV> But by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself . <EOV> <SOV> These words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him . <EOV> <SOV> Then again called they the man that was blind , and said unto him , Give God the praise : we know that this man is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they to him again , What did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , I have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are Moses ' disciples . <EOV> <SOV> We know that God spake unto Moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> The man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes . <EOV> <SOV> Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth . <EOV> <SOV> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind . <EOV> <SOV> If this man were not of God , he could do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Lord , I believe . And he worshipped him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , Are we blind also ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber . <EOV> <SOV> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice . <EOV> <SOV> And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers . <EOV> <SOV> This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them . <EOV> <SOV> I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture . <EOV> <SOV> The thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine . <EOV> <SOV> As the Father knoweth me , even so know I the Father : and I lay down my life for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again . <EOV> <SOV> No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received of my Father . <EOV> <SOV> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings . <EOV> <SOV> And many of them said , He hath a devil , and is mad ; why hear ye him ? <EOV> <SOV> Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a devil . Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ? <EOV> <SOV> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon 's porch . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou be the Christ , tell us plainly . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I do in my Father 's name , they bear witness of me . <EOV> <SOV> But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you . <EOV> <SOV> My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me : <EOV> <SOV> And I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand . <EOV> <SOV> My Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand . <EOV> <SOV> I and my Father are one . <EOV> <SOV> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewed you from my Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ? <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , saying , For a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ? <EOV> <SOV> If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came , and the scripture can not be broken ; <EOV> <SOV> Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not . <EOV> <SOV> But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore they sought again to take him : but he escaped out of their hand , <EOV> <SOV> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized ; and there he abode . <EOV> <SOV> And many resorted unto him , and said , John did no miracle : but all things that John spake of this man were true . <EOV> <SOV> And many believed on him there . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now a certain man was sick , named Lazarus , of Bethany , the town of Mary and her sister Martha . <EOV> <SOV> ( It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . ) <EOV> <SOV> Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus . <EOV> <SOV> When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was . <EOV> <SOV> Then after that saith he to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say unto him , Master , the Jews of late sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world . <EOV> <SOV> But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him . <EOV> <SOV> These things said he : and after that he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep . <EOV> <SOV> Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well . <EOV> <SOV> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead . <EOV> <SOV> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already . <EOV> <SOV> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off : <EOV> <SOV> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother . <EOV> <SOV> Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . <EOV> <SOV> But I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . Believest thou this ? <EOV> <SOV> She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee . <EOV> <SOV> As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there . <EOV> <SOV> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled . <EOV> <SOV> And said , Where have ye laid him ? They said unto him , Lord , come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus wept . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the Jews , Behold how he loved him ! <EOV> <SOV> And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . It was a cave , and a stone lay upon it . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done . <EOV> <SOV> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles . <EOV> <SOV> If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all , <EOV> <SOV> Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not . <EOV> <SOV> And this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ; <EOV> <SOV> And not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves . <EOV> <SOV> Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ? <EOV> <SOV> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , which should betray him , <EOV> <SOV> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ? <EOV> <SOV> This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this . <EOV> <SOV> For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ; <EOV> <SOV> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written , <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt . <EOV> <SOV> These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him . <EOV> <SOV> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him . <EOV> <SOV> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast : <EOV> <SOV> The same came therefore to Philip , which was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour . <EOV> <SOV> Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour . <EOV> <SOV> Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . <EOV> <SOV> The people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes . <EOV> <SOV> Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out . <EOV> <SOV> And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me . <EOV> <SOV> This he said , signifying what death he should die . <EOV> <SOV> The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ? <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth . <EOV> <SOV> While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them . <EOV> <SOV> But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him : <EOV> <SOV> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore they could not believe , because that Esaias said again , <EOV> <SOV> He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them . <EOV> <SOV> These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue : <EOV> <SOV> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world . <EOV> <SOV> He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak . <EOV> <SOV> And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever I speak therefore , even as the Father said unto me , so I speak . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end . <EOV> <SOV> And supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ; <EOV> <SOV> He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself . <EOV> <SOV> After that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh he to Simon Peter : and Peter saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter . <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all . <EOV> <SOV> For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean . <EOV> <SOV> So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am . <EOV> <SOV> If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another 's feet . <EOV> <SOV> For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him . <EOV> <SOV> If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them . <EOV> <SOV> I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me . <EOV> <SOV> Now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake . <EOV> <SOV> He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon . <EOV> <SOV> And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , That thou doest , do quickly . <EOV> <SOV> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him . <EOV> <SOV> For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor . <EOV> <SOV> He then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him . <EOV> <SOV> If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him . <EOV> <SOV> Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say to you . <EOV> <SOV> A new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . <EOV> <SOV> By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterwards . <EOV> <SOV> Peter said unto him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me . <EOV> <SOV> In my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you . <EOV> <SOV> And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also . <EOV> <SOV> And whither I go ye know , and the way ye know . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me . <EOV> <SOV> If ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him . <EOV> <SOV> Philip saith unto him , Lord , shew us the Father , and it sufficeth us . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how sayest thou then , Shew us the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works . <EOV> <SOV> Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father . <EOV> <SOV> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son . <EOV> <SOV> If ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it . <EOV> <SOV> If ye love me , keep my commandments . <EOV> <SOV> And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ; <EOV> <SOV> Even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world can not receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you . <EOV> <SOV> I will not leave you comfortless : I will come to you . <EOV> <SOV> Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also . <EOV> <SOV> At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him . <EOV> <SOV> Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's which sent me . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you . <EOV> <SOV> But the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you . If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for my Father is greater than I. <EOV> <SOV> And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe . <EOV> <SOV> Hereafter I will not talk much with you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in me . <EOV> <SOV> But that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . Arise , let us go hence . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman . <EOV> <SOV> Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit . <EOV> <SOV> Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me . <EOV> <SOV> I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned . <EOV> <SOV> If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples . <EOV> <SOV> As the Father hath loved me , so have I loved you : continue ye in my love . <EOV> <SOV> If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full . <EOV> <SOV> This is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you . <EOV> <SOV> Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you . <EOV> <SOV> Henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you . <EOV> <SOV> These things I command you , that ye love one another . <EOV> <SOV> If the world hate you , ye know that it hated me before it hated you . <EOV> <SOV> If ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you . <EOV> <SOV> Remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also . <EOV> <SOV> But all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloak for their sin . <EOV> <SOV> He that hateth me hateth my Father also . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father . <EOV> <SOV> But this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , They hated me without a cause . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me : <EOV> <SOV> And ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you , that ye should not be offended . <EOV> <SOV> They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service . <EOV> <SOV> And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me . <EOV> <SOV> But these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . And these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you . <EOV> <SOV> But now I go my way to him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment : <EOV> <SOV> Of sin , because they believe not on me ; <EOV> <SOV> Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ; <EOV> <SOV> Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged . <EOV> <SOV> I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now . <EOV> <SOV> Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come . <EOV> <SOV> He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you . <EOV> <SOV> All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you . <EOV> <SOV> A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we can not tell what he saith . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ? <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy . <EOV> <SOV> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you . <EOV> <SOV> And in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you . <EOV> <SOV> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father . <EOV> <SOV> At that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you : <EOV> <SOV> For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God . <EOV> <SOV> I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples said unto him , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no proverb . <EOV> <SOV> Now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me . <EOV> <SOV> These things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . In the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These words spake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee : <EOV> <SOV> As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him . <EOV> <SOV> And this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent . <EOV> <SOV> I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do . <EOV> <SOV> And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was . <EOV> <SOV> I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word . <EOV> <SOV> Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee . <EOV> <SOV> For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me . <EOV> <SOV> I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine . <EOV> <SOV> And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them . <EOV> <SOV> And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are . <EOV> <SOV> While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me I have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves . <EOV> <SOV> I have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil . <EOV> <SOV> They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth . <EOV> <SOV> As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth . <EOV> <SOV> Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ; <EOV> <SOV> That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one : <EOV> <SOV> I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me . <EOV> <SOV> Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world . <EOV> <SOV> O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon him , went forth , and said unto them , Whom seek ye ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . And Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them . <EOV> <SOV> As soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground . <EOV> <SOV> Then asked he them again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way : <EOV> <SOV> That the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none . <EOV> <SOV> Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant 's name was Malchus . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ? <EOV> <SOV> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him , <EOV> <SOV> And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year . <EOV> <SOV> Now Caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? He saith , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself . <EOV> <SOV> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what I have said unto them : behold , they know what I said . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ? <EOV> <SOV> Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . They said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? He denied it , and said , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> One of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate then went out unto them , and said , What accusation bring ye against this man ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , If he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up unto thee . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Pilate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death : <EOV> <SOV> That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die . <EOV> <SOV> Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ? <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a king . To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find in him no fault at all . <EOV> <SOV> But ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> Then cried they all again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and scourged him . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe , <EOV> <SOV> And said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they smote him with their hands . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him . <EOV> <SOV> Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . And Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man ! <EOV> <SOV> When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ; <EOV> <SOV> And went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin . <EOV> <SOV> And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar 's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King ! <EOV> <SOV> But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar . <EOV> <SOV> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away . <EOV> <SOV> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha : <EOV> <SOV> Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , What I have written I have written . <EOV> <SOV> Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did . <EOV> <SOV> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son ! <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home . <EOV> <SOV> After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him . <EOV> <SOV> But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs : <EOV> <SOV> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water . <EOV> <SOV> And he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe . <EOV> <SOV> For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken . <EOV> <SOV> And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced . <EOV> <SOV> And after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight . <EOV> <SOV> Then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid . <EOV> <SOV> There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie , <EOV> <SOV> And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself . <EOV> <SOV> Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed . <EOV> <SOV> For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples went away again unto their own home . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre , <EOV> <SOV> And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain . <EOV> <SOV> And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my LORD , and I know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> And when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turned herself , and saith unto him , Rabboni ; which is to say , Master . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God . <EOV> <SOV> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD , and that he had spoken these things unto her . <EOV> <SOV> Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the LORD . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be unto you : as my Father hath sent me , even so send I you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Ghost : <EOV> <SOV> Whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained . <EOV> <SOV> But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came . <EOV> <SOV> The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the LORD . But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing . <EOV> <SOV> And Thomas answered and said unto him , My LORD and my God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed . <EOV> <SOV> And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book : <EOV> <SOV> But these are written , that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye might have life through his name . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; and on this wise shewed he himself . <EOV> <SOV> There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . They say unto him , We also go with thee . They went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing . <EOV> <SOV> But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus saith unto them , Children , have ye any meat ? They answered him , No . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his fisher 's coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes . <EOV> <SOV> As soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , Bring of the fish which ye have now caught . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , an hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , Come and dine . And none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus then cometh , and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish likewise . <EOV> <SOV> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> So when they had dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my lambs . <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him again the second time , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto him the third time , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , Lovest thou me ? And he said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I love thee . Jesus saith unto him , Feed my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdest thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not . <EOV> <SOV> This spake he , signifying by what death he should glorify God . And when he had spoken this , he saith unto him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following ; which also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , Lord , which is he that betrayeth thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus , Lord , and what shall this man do ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? follow thou me . <EOV> <SOV> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet Jesus said not unto him , He shall not die ; but , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true . <EOV> <SOV> And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
