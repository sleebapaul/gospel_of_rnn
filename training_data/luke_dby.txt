<SOC> <SOV> Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us , <EOV> <SOV> as those who from the beginning were eye - witnesses of and attendants on the Word have delivered them to us , <EOV> <SOV> it has seemed good to * me * also , accurately acquainted from the origin with all things , to write to thee with method , most excellent Theophilus , <EOV> <SOV> that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed . <EOV> <SOV> There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest , by name Zacharias , of the course of Abia , and his wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name Elizabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they were both just before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless . <EOV> <SOV> And they had no child , because Elizabeth was barren , and they were both advanced in years . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course , <EOV> <SOV> it fell to him by lot , according to the custom of the priesthood , to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense . <EOV> <SOV> And all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And an angel of [ the ] Lord appeared to him , standing on the right of the altar of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias was troubled , seeing [ him ] , and fear fell upon him . <EOV> <SOV> But the angel said to him , Fear not , Zacharias , because thy supplication has been heard , and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John . <EOV> <SOV> And he shall be to thee joy and rejoicing , and many shall rejoice at his birth . <EOV> <SOV> For he shall be great before [ the ] Lord , and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with [ the ] Holy Spirit , even from his mother 's womb . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to [ the ] Lord their God . <EOV> <SOV> And * he * shall go before him in [ the ] spirit and power of Elias , to turn hearts of fathers to children , and disobedient ones to [ the ] thoughts of just [ men ] , to make ready for [ the ] Lord a prepared people . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias said to the angel , How shall I know this , for * I * am an old man , and my wife advanced in years ? <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answering , said to him , * I * am Gabriel , who stand before God , and I have been sent to speak to thee , and to bring these glad tidings to thee ; <EOV> <SOV> and behold , thou shalt be silent and not able to speak , till the day in which these things shall take place , because thou hast not believed my words , the which shall be fulfilled in their time . <EOV> <SOV> And the people were awaiting Zacharias , and they wondered at his delaying in the temple . <EOV> <SOV> But when he came out he could not speak to them , and they recognised that he had seen a vision in the temple . And he was making signs to them , and continued dumb . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the days of his service were completed , he departed to his house . <EOV> <SOV> Now after these days , Elizabeth his wife conceived , and hid herself five months , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Thus has [ the ] Lord done to me in [ these ] days in which he looked upon [ me ] to take away my reproach among men . <EOV> <SOV> But in the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent of God to a city of Galilee , of which [ the ] name [ was ] Nazareth , <EOV> <SOV> to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name [ was ] Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name [ was ] Mary . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel came in to her , and said , Hail , [ thou ] favoured one ! the Lord [ is ] with thee : [ blessed art * thou * amongst women ] . <EOV> <SOV> But she , [ seeing ] [ the angel ] , was troubled at his word , and reasoned in her mind what this salutation might be . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said to her , Fear not , Mary , for thou hast found favour with God ; <EOV> <SOV> and behold , thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> * He * shall be great , and shall be called Son of [ the ] Highest ; and [ the ] Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father ; <EOV> <SOV> and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages , and of his kingdom there shall not be an end . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary said to the angel , How shall this be , since I know not a man ? <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answering said to her , [ The ] Holy Spirit shall come upon thee , and power of [ the ] Highest overshadow thee , wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , Elizabeth , thy kinswoman , she also has conceived a son in her old age , and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren : <EOV> <SOV> for nothing shall be impossible with God . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , Behold the bondmaid of [ the ] Lord ; be it to me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary , rising up in those days , went into the hill country with haste , to a city of Judah , <EOV> <SOV> and entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elizabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elizabeth was filled with [ the ] Holy Spirit , <EOV> <SOV> and cried out with a loud voice and said , Blessed [ art ] * thou * amongst women , and blessed the fruit of thy womb . <EOV> <SOV> And whence [ is ] this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ? <EOV> <SOV> For behold , as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears , the babe leaped with joy in my womb . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed [ is ] she that has believed , for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from [ the ] Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , My soul magnifies the Lord , <EOV> <SOV> and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour . <EOV> <SOV> For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid ; for behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed . <EOV> <SOV> For the Mighty One has done to me great things , and holy [ is ] his name ; <EOV> <SOV> and his mercy [ is ] to generations and generations to them that fear him . <EOV> <SOV> He has wrought strength with his arm ; he has scattered haughty [ ones ] in the thought of their heart . <EOV> <SOV> He has put down rulers from thrones , and exalted the lowly . <EOV> <SOV> He has filled the hungry with good things , and sent away the rich empty . <EOV> <SOV> He has helped Israel his servant , in order to remember mercy , <EOV> <SOV> ( as he spoke to our fathers , ) to Abraham and to his seed for ever . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her house . <EOV> <SOV> But the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth that she should bring forth , and she gave birth to a son . <EOV> <SOV> And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that [ the ] Lord had magnified his mercy with her , and they rejoiced with her . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they called it after the name of his father , Zacharias . <EOV> <SOV> And his mother answering said , No ; but he shall be called John . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to her , There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name . <EOV> <SOV> And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called . <EOV> <SOV> And having asked for a writing - table , he wrote saying , John is his name . And they all wondered . <EOV> <SOV> And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue , and he spake , blessing God . <EOV> <SOV> And fear came upon all who dwelt round about them ; and in the whole hill - country of Judaea all these things were the subject of conversation . <EOV> <SOV> And all who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , What then will this child be ? And [ the ] Lord 's hand was with him . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias his father was filled with [ the ] Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Blessed be [ the ] Lord the God of Israel , because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people , <EOV> <SOV> and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of David his servant ; <EOV> <SOV> as he spoke by [ the ] mouth of his holy prophets , who have been since the world began ; <EOV> <SOV> deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us ; <EOV> <SOV> to fulfil mercy with our fathers and remember his holy covenant , <EOV> <SOV> [ the ] oath which he swore to Abraham our father , <EOV> <SOV> to give us , that , saved out of the hand of our enemies , we should serve him without fear <EOV> <SOV> in piety and righteousness before him all our days . <EOV> <SOV> And * thou * , child , shalt be called [ the ] prophet of [ the ] Highest ; for thou shalt go before the face of [ the ] Lord to make ready his ways ; <EOV> <SOV> to give knowledge of deliverance to his people by [ the ] remission of their sins <EOV> <SOV> on account of [ the ] bowels of mercy of our God ; wherein [ the ] dayspring from on high has visited us , <EOV> <SOV> to shine upon them who were sitting in darkness and in [ the ] shadow of death , to guide our feet into [ the ] way of peace . <EOV> <SOV> -- And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit ; and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus , that a census should be made of all the habitable world . <EOV> <SOV> The census itself first took place when Cyrenius had the government of Syria . <EOV> <SOV> And all went to be inscribed in the census roll , each to his own city : <EOV> <SOV> and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city Nazareth to Judaea , to David 's city , the which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David , <EOV> <SOV> to be inscribed in the census roll with Mary who was betrothed to him [ as his ] wife , she being great with child . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while they were there , the days of her giving birth [ to her child ] were fulfilled , <EOV> <SOV> and she brought forth her first - born son , and wrapped him up in swaddling - clothes and laid him in the manger , because there was no room for them in the inn . <EOV> <SOV> And there were shepherds in that country abiding without , and keeping watch by night over their flock . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , an angel of [ the ] Lord was there by them , and [ the ] glory of [ the ] Lord shone around them , and they feared [ with ] great fear . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said to them , Fear not , for behold , I announce to you glad tidings of great joy , which shall be to all the people ; <EOV> <SOV> for to - day a Saviour has been born to you in David 's city , who is Christ [ the ] Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the sign to you : ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling - clothes , and lying in a manger . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good pleasure in men . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as the angels departed from them into heaven , that the shepherds said to one another , Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem , and let us see this thing that is come to pass , which the Lord has made known to us . <EOV> <SOV> And they came with haste , and found both Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger ; <EOV> <SOV> and having seen [ it ] they made known about the country the thing which had been said to them concerning this child . <EOV> <SOV> And all who heard [ it ] wondered at the things said to them by the shepherds . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary kept all these things [ in her mind ] , pondering [ them ] in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all things which they had heard and seen , as it had been said to them . <EOV> <SOV> And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him , his name was called Jesus , which was the name given by the angel before he had been conceived in the womb . <EOV> <SOV> And when the days were fulfilled for their purifying according to the law of Moses , they brought him to Jerusalem to present [ him ] to the Lord <EOV> <SOV> ( as it is written in the law of [ the ] Lord : Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ) , <EOV> <SOV> and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of [ the ] Lord : A pair of turtle doves , or two young pigeons . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon ; and this man was just and pious , awaiting the consolation of Israel , and [ the ] Holy Spirit was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit , that he should not see death before he should see [ the ] Lord 's Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he came in the Spirit into the temple ; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law , <EOV> <SOV> * he * received him into his arms , and blessed God , and said , <EOV> <SOV> Lord , now thou lettest thy bondman go , according to thy word , in peace ; <EOV> <SOV> for mine eyes have seen thy salvation , <EOV> <SOV> which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples ; <EOV> <SOV> a light for revelation of [ the ] Gentiles and [ the ] glory of thy people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And his father and mother wondered at the things which were said concerning him . <EOV> <SOV> And Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary his mother , Lo , this [ child ] is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel , and for a sign spoken against ; <EOV> <SOV> ( and even a sword shall go through thine own soul ; ) so that [ the ] thoughts may be revealed from many hearts . <EOV> <SOV> And there was a prophetess , Anna , daughter of Phanuel , of [ the ] tribe of Asher , who was far advanced in years , having lived with [ her ] husband seven years from her virginity , <EOV> <SOV> and herself a widow up to eighty - four years ; who did not depart from the temple , serving night and day with fastings and prayers ; <EOV> <SOV> and she coming up the same hour gave praise to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had completed all things according to the law of [ the ] Lord , they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew and waxed strong [ in spirit ] , filled with wisdom , and God 's grace was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And his parents went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was twelve years old , and they went up [ to Jerusalem ] according to the custom of the feast <EOV> <SOV> and had completed the days , as they returned , the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem , and his parents knew not [ of it ] ; <EOV> <SOV> but , supposing him to be in the company that journeyed together , they went a day 's journey , and sought him among their relations and acquaintances : <EOV> <SOV> and not having found him they returned to Jerusalem seeking him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers and hearing them and asking them questions . <EOV> <SOV> And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him they were amazed : and his mother said to him , Child , why hast thou dealt thus with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee distressed . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why [ is it ] that ye have sought me ? did ye not know that I ought to be [ occupied ] in my Father 's business ? <EOV> <SOV> And they understood not the thing that he said to them . <EOV> <SOV> And he went down with them and came to Nazareth , and he was in subjection to them . And his mother kept all these things in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and men . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea , and Herod tetrarch of Galilee , and Philip his brother tetrarch of Ituraea and the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene , <EOV> <SOV> in the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas , [ the ] word of God came upon John , the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness . <EOV> <SOV> And he came into all the district round the Jordan , preaching [ the ] baptism of repentance for [ the ] remission of sins , <EOV> <SOV> as it is written in [ the ] book of [ the ] words of Esaias the prophet : Voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare ye the way of [ the ] Lord , make straight his paths . <EOV> <SOV> Every gorge shall be filled up , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low , and the crooked [ places ] shall become a straight [ path ] , and the rough places smooth ways , <EOV> <SOV> and all flesh shall see the salvation of God . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore to the crowds which went out to be baptised by him , Offspring of vipers , who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath ? <EOV> <SOV> Produce therefore fruits worthy of repentance ; and begin not to say in yourselves , We have Abraham for [ our ] father , for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And already also the axe is applied to the root of the trees ; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into [ the ] fire . <EOV> <SOV> And the crowds asked him saying , What should we do then ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering says to them , He that has two body - coats , let him give to him that has none ; and he that has food , let him do likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And tax - gatherers came also to be baptised , and they said to him , Teacher , what should we do ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take no more [ money ] than what is appointed to you . <EOV> <SOV> And persons engaged in military service also asked him saying , And we , what should we do ? And he said to them , Oppress no one , nor accuse falsely , and be satisfied with your pay . <EOV> <SOV> But as the people were in expectation , and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John whether * he * might be the Christ , <EOV> <SOV> John answered all , saying , * I * indeed baptise you with water , but the mightier than I is coming , the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to unloose ; * he * shall baptise you with [ the ] Holy Spirit and fire ; <EOV> <SOV> whose winnowing - fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly purge his threshing - floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . <EOV> <SOV> Exhorting then many other things also he announced [ his ] glad tidings to the people . <EOV> <SOV> But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him as to Herodias , the wife of his brother , and as to all the wicked things which Herod had done , <EOV> <SOV> added this also to all [ the rest ] , that he shut up John in prison . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , all the people having been baptised , and Jesus having been baptised and praying , that the heaven was opened , <EOV> <SOV> and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a dove upon him ; and a voice came out of heaven , * Thou * art my beloved Son , in thee I have found my delight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years old ; being as was supposed son of Joseph ; of Eli , <EOV> <SOV> of Matthat , of Levi , of Melchi , of Janna , of Joseph , <EOV> <SOV> of Mattathias , of Amos , of Naoum , of Esli , of Naggai , <EOV> <SOV> of Maath , of Mattathias , of Semei , of Joseph , of Juda , <EOV> <SOV> of Joannes , of Resa , of Zorobabel , of Salathiel , of Neri , <EOV> <SOV> of Melchi , of Addi , of Cosam , of Elmodam , of Er , <EOV> <SOV> of Joses , of Eliezer , of Joreim , of Matthat , of Levi , <EOV> <SOV> of Simeon , of Juda , of Joseph , of Jonan , of Eliakim , <EOV> <SOV> of Meleas , of Menan , of Mattatha , of Nathan , of David , <EOV> <SOV> of Jesse , of Obed , of Booz , of Salmon , of Naasson , <EOV> <SOV> of Aminadab , of Aram , of Esrom , of Phares , of Juda , <EOV> <SOV> of Jacob , of Isaac , of Abraham , of Terah , of Nachor , <EOV> <SOV> of Seruch , of Ragau , of Phalek , of Eber , of Sala , <EOV> <SOV> of Cainan , of Arphaxad , of Sem , of Noe , of Lamech , <EOV> <SOV> of Methusala , of Enoch , of Jared , of Maleleel , of Cainan , <EOV> <SOV> of Enos , of Seth , of Adam , of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But Jesus , full of [ the ] Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan , and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness <EOV> <SOV> forty days , tempted of the devil ; and in those days he did not eat anything , and when they were finished he hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said to him , If thou be Son of God , speak to this stone , that it become bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered unto him saying , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . <EOV> <SOV> And [ the devil ] , leading him up into a high mountain , shewed him all the kingdoms of the habitable world in a moment of time . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said to him , I will give thee all this power , and their glory ; for it is given up to me , and to whomsoever I will I give it . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore * thou * wilt do homage before me , all [ of it ] shall be thine . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering him said , It is written , Thou shalt do homage to [ the ] Lord thy God , and him alone shalt thou serve . <EOV> <SOV> And he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the edge of the temple , and said to him , If thou be Son of God , cast thyself down hence ; <EOV> <SOV> for it is written , He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee to keep thee ; <EOV> <SOV> and on [ their ] hands shall they bear thee , lest in any wise thou strike thy foot against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt [ the ] Lord thy God . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil , having completed every temptation , departed from him for a time . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee ; and a rumour went out into the whole surrounding country about him ; <EOV> <SOV> and * he * taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Nazareth , where he was brought up ; and he entered , according to his custom , into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up to read . <EOV> <SOV> And [ the ] book of the prophet Esaias was given to him ; and having unrolled the book he found the place where it was written , <EOV> <SOV> [ The ] Spirit of [ the ] Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me to preach glad tidings to [ the ] poor ; he has sent me to preach to captives deliverance , and to [ the ] blind sight , to send forth [ the ] crushed delivered , <EOV> <SOV> to preach [ the ] acceptable year of [ the ] Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And having rolled up the book , when he had delivered it up to the attendant , he sat down ; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to say to them , To - day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears . <EOV> <SOV> And all bore witness to him , and wondered at the words of grace which were coming out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this the son of Joseph ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Ye will surely say to me this parable , Physician , heal thyself ; whatsoever we have heard has taken place in Capernaum do here also in thine own country . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Verily I say to you , that no prophet is acceptable in his [ own ] country . <EOV> <SOV> But of a truth I say to you , There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months , so that a great famine came upon all the land , <EOV> <SOV> and to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta of Sidonia , to a woman [ that was ] a widow . <EOV> <SOV> And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet , and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all filled with rage in the synagogue , hearing these things ; <EOV> <SOV> and rising up they cast him forth out of the city , and led him up to the brow of the mountain upon which their city was built , so that they might throw him down the precipice ; <EOV> <SOV> but * he * , passing through the midst of them , went his way , <EOV> <SOV> and descended to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbaths . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished at his doctrine , for his word was with authority . <EOV> <SOV> And there was in the synagogue a man having a spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried with a loud voice , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Eh ! what have we to do with thee , Jesus , Nazarene ? hast thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy [ One ] of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out from him . And the demon , having thrown him down into the midst , came out from him without doing him any injury . <EOV> <SOV> And astonishment came upon all , and they spoke to one another , saying , What word [ is ] this ? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits , and they come out . <EOV> <SOV> And a rumour went out into every place of the country round concerning him . <EOV> <SOV> And rising up out of the synagogue , he entered into the house of Simon . But Simon 's mother - in - law was suffering under a bad fever ; and they asked him for her . <EOV> <SOV> And standing over her , he rebuked the fever , and it left her ; and forthwith standing up she served them . <EOV> <SOV> And when the sun went down , all , as many as had persons sick with divers diseases , brought them to him , and having laid his hands on every one of them , he healed them ; <EOV> <SOV> and demons also went out from many , crying out and saying , * Thou * art the Son of God . And rebuking them , he suffered them not to speak , because they knew him to be the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day he went out , and went into a desert place , and the crowds sought after him , and came up to him , and [ would have ] kept him back that he should not go from them . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , I must needs announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also , for for this I have been sent forth . <EOV> <SOV> And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , as the crowd pressed on him to hear the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret : <EOV> <SOV> and he saw two ships standing by the lake , but the fishermen , having come down from them , were washing their nets . <EOV> <SOV> And getting into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , he asked him to draw out a little from the land ; and he sat down and taught the crowds out of the ship . <EOV> <SOV> But when he ceased speaking , he said to Simon , Draw out into the deep [ water ] and let down your nets for a haul . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon answering said to him , Master , having laboured through the whole night we have taken nothing , but at thy word I will let down the net . <EOV> <SOV> And having done this , they enclosed a great multitude of fishes . And their net broke . <EOV> <SOV> And they beckoned to their partners who were in the other ship to come and help them , and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they were sinking . <EOV> <SOV> But Simon Peter , seeing it , fell at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord . <EOV> <SOV> For astonishment had laid hold on him , and on all those who were with him , at the haul of fishes which they had taken ; <EOV> <SOV> and in like manner also on James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , Fear not ; henceforth thou shalt be catching men . <EOV> <SOV> And having run the ships on shore , leaving all they followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he was in one of the cities , that behold , there was a man full of leprosy , and seeing Jesus , falling upon his face , he besought him saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou art able to cleanse me . <EOV> <SOV> And stretching forth his hand he touched him , saying , I will ; be thou cleansed : and immediately the leprosy departed from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he enjoined him to tell no one ; but go , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing as Moses ordained , for a testimony to them . <EOV> <SOV> But the report concerning him was spread abroad still more , and great crowds came together to hear , and to be healed from their infirmities . <EOV> <SOV> And * he * withdrew himself , and was about in the desert [ places ] and praying . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on one of the days , that * he * was teaching , and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judaea and [ out of ] Jerusalem ; and [ the ] Lord 's power was [ there ] to heal them . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , men bringing upon a couch a man who was paralysed ; and they sought to bring him in , and put [ him ] before him . <EOV> <SOV> And not finding what way to bring him in , on account of the crowd , going up on the housetop they let him down through the tiles , with his little couch , into the midst before Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing their faith , he said , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason [ in their minds ] , saying , Who is this who speaks blasphemies ? Who is able to forgive sins but God alone ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , knowing their reasonings , answering said to them , Why reason ye in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins , he said to the paralysed man , I say to thee , Arise , and take up thy little couch and go to thine house . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately standing up before them , having taken up that whereon he was laid , he departed to his house , glorifying God . <EOV> <SOV> And astonishment seized all , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to - day . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he went forth and saw a tax - gatherer , Levi by name , sitting at the receipt of taxes , and said to him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And having left all , rising up , he followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house , and there was a great crowd of tax - gatherers and others who were at table with them . <EOV> <SOV> And their scribes and the Pharisees murmured at his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with tax - gatherers and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , They that are in sound health have not need of a physician , but those that are ill . <EOV> <SOV> I am not come to call righteous [ persons ] , but sinful [ ones ] to repentance . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Why do the disciples of John fast often and make supplications , in like manner those also of the Pharisees , but thine eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast when the bridegroom is with them ? <EOV> <SOV> But days will come when also the bridegroom will have been taken away from them ; then shall they fast in those days . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke also a parable to them : No one puts a piece of a new garment upon an old garment , otherwise he will both rend the new , and the piece which is from the new will not suit with the old . <EOV> <SOV> And no one puts new wine into old skins , otherwise the new wine will burst the skins , and it will be poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; <EOV> <SOV> but new wine is to be put into new skins , and both are preserved . <EOV> <SOV> And no one having drunk old wine [ straightway ] wishes for new , for he says , The old is better . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass on [ the ] second - first sabbath , that he went through cornfields , and his disciples were plucking the ears and eating [ them ] , rubbing [ them ] in their hands . <EOV> <SOV> But some of the Pharisees said to them , Why do ye what is not lawful to do on the sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did when he hungered , he and those who were with him , <EOV> <SOV> how he entered into the house of God and took the shewbread and ate , and gave to those also who were with him , which it is not lawful that [ any ] eat , unless the priests alone ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on another sabbath also that he entered into the synagogue and taught ; and there was a man there , and his right hand was withered . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching if he would heal on the sabbath , that they might find something of which to accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> But * he * knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , Get up , and stand in the midst . And having risen up he stood [ there ] . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to them , I will ask you if it is lawful on the sabbath to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy [ it ] ? <EOV> <SOV> And having looked around on them all , he said to him , Stretch out thy hand . And he did [ so ] and his hand was restored as the other . <EOV> <SOV> But * they * were filled with madness , and they spoke together among themselves what they should do to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray , and he spent the night in prayer to God . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day he called his disciples , and having chosen out twelve from them , whom also he named apostles : <EOV> <SOV> Simon , to whom also he gave the name of Peter , and Andrew his brother , [ and ] James and John , [ and ] Philip and Bartholomew , <EOV> <SOV> [ and ] Matthew and Thomas , James the [ son ] of Alphaeus and Simon who was called Zealot , <EOV> <SOV> [ and ] Judas [ brother ] of James , and Judas Iscariote , who was also [ his ] betrayer ; <EOV> <SOV> and having descended with them , he stood on a level place , and a crowd of his disciples , and a great multitude of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem , and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ; <EOV> <SOV> and those that were beset by unclean spirits were healed . <EOV> <SOV> And all the crowd sought to touch him , for power went out from him and healed all . <EOV> <SOV> And * he * , lifting up his eyes upon his disciples , said , Blessed [ are ] ye poor , for yours is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed ye that hunger now , for ye shall be filled . Blessed ye that weep now , for ye shall laugh . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you [ from them ] , and shall reproach [ you ] , and cast out your name as wicked , for the Son of man 's sake : <EOV> <SOV> rejoice in that day and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in the heaven , for after this manner did their fathers act toward the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to you rich , for ye have received your consolation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you that are filled , for ye shall hunger . Woe to you who laugh now , for ye shall mourn and weep . <EOV> <SOV> Woe , when all men speak well of you , for after this manner did their fathers to the false prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But to you that hear I say , Love your enemies ; do good to those that hate you ; <EOV> <SOV> bless those that curse you ; pray for those who use you despitefully . <EOV> <SOV> To him that smites thee on the cheek , offer also the other ; and from him that would take away thy garment , forbid not thy body - coat also . <EOV> <SOV> To every one that asks of thee , give ; and from him that takes away what is thine , ask it not back . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye wish that men should do to you , do * ye * also to them in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye love those that love you , what thank is it to you ? for even sinners love those that love them . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye do good to those that do good to you , what thank is it to you ? for even sinners do the same . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye lend to those from whom ye hope to receive , what thank is it to you ? [ for ] even sinners lend to sinners that they may receive the like . <EOV> <SOV> But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing in return , and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be sons of [ the ] Highest ; for * he * is good to the unthankful and wicked . <EOV> <SOV> Be ye therefore merciful , even as your Father also is merciful . <EOV> <SOV> And judge not , and ye shall not be judged ; condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned . Remit , and it shall be remitted to you . <EOV> <SOV> Give , and it shall be given to you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall be given into your bosom : for with the same measure with which ye mete it shall be measured to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke also a parable to them : Can a blind [ man ] lead a blind [ man ] ? shall not both fall into [ the ] ditch ? <EOV> <SOV> The disciple is not above his teacher , but every one that is perfected shall be as his teacher . <EOV> <SOV> But why lookest thou on the mote which is in the eye of thy brother , but perceivest not the beam which is in thine own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> or how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , allow [ me ] , I will cast out the mote that is in thine eye , thyself not seeing the beam that is in thine eye ? Hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine eye , and then thou shalt see clear to cast out the mote which is in the eye of thy brother . <EOV> <SOV> For there is no good tree which produces corrupt fruit , nor a corrupt tree which produces good fruit ; <EOV> <SOV> for every tree is known by its own fruit , for figs are not gathered from thorns , nor grapes vintaged from a bramble . <EOV> <SOV> The good man , out of the good treasure of his heart , brings forth good ; and the wicked [ man ] out of the wicked , brings forth what is wicked : for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks . <EOV> <SOV> And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things that I say ? <EOV> <SOV> Every one that comes to me , and hears my words and does them , I will shew you to whom he is like . <EOV> <SOV> He is like a man building a house , who dug and went deep , and laid a foundation on the rock ; but a great rain coming , the stream broke upon that house , and could not shake it , for it had been founded on the rock . <EOV> <SOV> And he that has heard and not done , is like a man who has built a house on the ground without [ a ] foundation , on which the stream broke , and immediately it fell , and the breach of that house was great . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when he had completed all his words in the hearing of the people , he entered into Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain centurion 's bondman who was dear to him was ill and about to die ; <EOV> <SOV> and having heard of Jesus , he sent to him elders of the Jews , begging him that he might come and save his bondman . <EOV> <SOV> But they , being come to Jesus , besought him diligently , saying , He is worthy to whom thou shouldest grant this , <EOV> <SOV> for he loves our nation , and himself has built the synagogue for us . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went with them . But already , when he was not far from the house , the centurion sent to him friends , saying to him , Lord , do not trouble thyself , for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee . But say by a word and my servant shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> For * I * also am a man placed under authority , having under myself soldiers , and I say to this [ one ] , Go , and he goes ; and to another , Come , and he comes ; and to my bondman , Do this , and he does [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus hearing this wondered at him , and turning to the crowd following him said , I say to you , Not even in Israel have I found so great faith . <EOV> <SOV> And they who had been sent returning to the house found the bondman , who was ill , in good health . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass afterwards he went into a city called Nain , and many of his disciples and a great crowd went with him . <EOV> <SOV> And as he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , a dead man was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she a widow , and a very considerable crowd of the city [ was ] with her . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord , seeing her , was moved with compassion for her , and said to her , Weep not ; <EOV> <SOV> and coming up he touched the bier , and the bearers stopped . And he said , Youth , I say to thee , Wake up . <EOV> <SOV> And the dead sat up and began to speak ; and he gave him to his mother . <EOV> <SOV> And fear seized on all , and they glorified God , saying , A great prophet has been raised up amongst us ; and God has visited his people . <EOV> <SOV> And this report went out in all Judaea concerning him , and in all the surrounding country . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John brought him word concerning all these things : <EOV> <SOV> and John , having called two of his disciples , sent to Jesus , saying , Art * thou * he that is coming , or are we to wait for another ? <EOV> <SOV> But the men having come to him said , John the baptist has sent us to thee , saying , Art * thou * he that is coming , or are we to wait for another ? <EOV> <SOV> In that hour he healed many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits , and to many blind he granted sight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , Go , bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard : that blind see , lame walk , lepers are cleansed , deaf hear , dead are raised , poor are evangelized ; <EOV> <SOV> and blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me . <EOV> <SOV> And the messengers of John having departed , he began to speak to the crowds concerning John : What went ye out into the wilderness to behold ? a reed shaken by the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in delicate garments ? Behold , those who are in splendid clothing and live luxuriously are in the courts of kings . <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? a prophet ? Yea , I say to you , and [ what is ] more excellent than a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> This is he concerning whom it is written , Behold , * I * send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say unto you , Among them that are born of women a greater [ prophet ] is no one than John [ the baptist ] ; but he who is a little one in the kingdom of God is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> ( And all the people who heard [ it ] , and the tax - gatherers , justified God , having been baptised with the baptism of John ; <EOV> <SOV> but the Pharisees and the lawyers rendered null as to themselves the counsel of God , not having been baptised by him . ) <EOV> <SOV> To whom therefore shall I liken the men of this generation , and to whom are they like ? <EOV> <SOV> They are like children sitting in the market - place , and calling one to another and saying , We have piped to you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept . <EOV> <SOV> For John the baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and ye say , He has a demon . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man has come eating and drinking , and ye say , Behold an eater and wine - drinker , a friend of tax - gatherers and sinners ; <EOV> <SOV> and wisdom has been justified of all her children . <EOV> <SOV> But one of the Pharisees begged him that he would eat with him . And entering into the house of the Pharisee he took his place at table ; <EOV> <SOV> and behold , a woman in the city , who was a sinner , and knew that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee , having taken an alabaster box of myrrh , <EOV> <SOV> and standing at his feet behind [ him ] weeping , began to wash his feet with tears ; and she wiped them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed [ them ] with the myrrh . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisee who had invited him , seeing it , spoke with himself saying , This [ person ] if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him , for she is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him , Simon , I have somewhat to say to thee . And he says , Teacher , say [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> There were two debtors of a certain creditor : one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty ; <EOV> <SOV> but as they had nothing to pay , he forgave both of them [ their debt ] : [ say , ] which of them therefore will love him most ? <EOV> <SOV> And Simon answering said , I suppose he to whom he forgave the most . And he said to him , Thou hast rightly judged . <EOV> <SOV> And turning to the woman he said to Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house ; thou gavest me not water on my feet , but * she * has washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with her hair . <EOV> <SOV> Thou gavest me not a kiss , but * she * from the time I came in has not ceased kissing my feet . <EOV> <SOV> My head with oil thou didst not anoint , but * she * has anointed my feet with myrrh . <EOV> <SOV> For which cause I say to thee , Her many sins are forgiven ; for she loved much ; but he to whom little is forgiven loves little . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , Thy sins are forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were with [ them ] at table began to say within themselves , Who is this who forgives also sins ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the woman , Thy faith has saved thee ; go in peace . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass afterwards that * he * went through [ the country ] city by city , and village by village , preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God ; and the twelve [ were ] with him , <EOV> <SOV> and certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities , Mary who was called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out , <EOV> <SOV> and Joanna , wife of Chuza , Herod 's steward , and Susanna , and many others , who ministered to him of their substance . <EOV> <SOV> And a great crowd coming together , and those who were coming to him out of each city , he spoke by parable : <EOV> <SOV> The sower went out to sow his seed ; and as he sowed , some fell along the way , and it was trodden under foot , and the birds of the heaven devoured it up ; <EOV> <SOV> and other fell upon the rock , and having sprung up , it was dried up because it had not moisture ; <EOV> <SOV> and other fell in the midst of the thorns , and the thorns having sprung up with [ it ] choked it ; <EOV> <SOV> and other fell into the good ground , and having sprung up bore fruit a hundredfold . As he said these things he cried , He that has ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him [ saying ] , What may this parable be ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God , but to the rest in parables , in order that seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . <EOV> <SOV> But the parable is this : The seed is the word of God . <EOV> <SOV> But those by the wayside are those who hear ; then comes the devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved . <EOV> <SOV> But those upon the rock , those who when they hear receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , who believe for a time , and in time of trial fall away . <EOV> <SOV> But that that fell where the thorns were , these are they who having heard go away and are choked under cares and riches and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to perfection . <EOV> <SOV> But that in the good ground , these are they who in an honest and good heart , having heard the word keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience . <EOV> <SOV> And no one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch , but sets it on a lamp - stand , that they who enter in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> For there is nothing hid which shall not become manifest , nor secret which shall not be known and come to light . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed therefore how ye hear ; for whosoever has , to him shall be given , and whosoever has not , even what he seems to have shall be taken from him . <EOV> <SOV> And his mother and his brethren came to him , and could not get to him because of the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> And it was told him [ saying ] , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , wishing to see thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to them , My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on one of the days , that * he * entered into a ship , himself and his disciples ; and he said to them , Let us pass over to the other side of the lake ; and they set off from shore . <EOV> <SOV> And as they sailed , he fell asleep ; and a sudden squall of wind came down on the lake , and they were filled [ with water ] , and were in danger ; <EOV> <SOV> and coming to [ him ] they woke him up , saying , Master , master , we perish . But he , rising up , rebuked the wind and the raging of the water ; and they ceased , and there was a calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Where is your faith ? And , being afraid , they were astonished , saying to one another , Who then is this , that he commands even the winds and the water , and they obey him ? <EOV> <SOV> And they arrived in the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And as he got out [ of the ship ] on the land , a certain man out of the city met him , who had demons a long time , and put on no clothes , and did not abide in a house , but in the tombs . <EOV> <SOV> But seeing Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus Son of the Most High God ? I beseech thee torment me not . <EOV> <SOV> For he had commanded the unclean spirit to go out from the man . For very often it had seized him ; and he had been bound , kept with chains and fetters ; and breaking the bonds he was driven by the demon into the deserts . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus asked him saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : for many demons had entered into him . <EOV> <SOV> And they besought him that he would not command them to go away into the bottomless pit . <EOV> <SOV> And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain , and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into those ; and he suffered them . <EOV> <SOV> And the demons , going out from the man , entered into the swine , and the herd rushed down the precipice into the lake , and were choked . <EOV> <SOV> But they that fed [ them ] , seeing what had happened , fled , and told [ it ] to the city and to the country . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out to see what had happened , and came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting , clothed and sensible , at the feet of Jesus . And they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And they also who had seen it told them how the possessed man had been healed . <EOV> <SOV> And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them , for they were possessed with great fear ; and * he * , entering into the ship , returned . <EOV> <SOV> But the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him . But he sent him away , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Return to thine house and relate how great things God has done for thee . And he went away through the whole city , publishing how great things Jesus had done for him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus returned , the crowd received him gladly , for they were all expecting him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a man came , whose name was Jairus , and he was [ a ] ruler of the synagogue , and falling at the feet of Jesus besought him to come to his house , <EOV> <SOV> because he had an only daughter , about twelve years old , and she was dying . And as he went the crowds thronged him . <EOV> <SOV> And a woman who had a flux of blood since twelve years , who , having spent all her living on physicians , could not be cured by any one , <EOV> <SOV> coming up behind , touched the hem of his garment , and immediately her flux of blood stopped . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Who has touched me ? But all denying , Peter and those with him said , Master , the crowds close thee in and press upon thee , and sayest thou , Who has touched me ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Some one has touched me , for * I * have known that power has gone out from me . <EOV> <SOV> And the woman , seeing that she was not hid , came trembling , and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was immediately healed . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , [ Be of good courage , ] daughter ; thy faith has healed thee ; go in peace . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking , comes some one from the ruler of the synagogue , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; do not trouble the teacher . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , hearing it , answered him saying , Fear not : only believe , and she shall be made well . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to the house he suffered no one to go in but Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother . <EOV> <SOV> And all were weeping and lamenting her . But he said , Do not weep , for she has not died , but sleeps . <EOV> <SOV> And they derided him , knowing that she had died . <EOV> <SOV> But * he * , having turned them all out and taking hold of her hand , cried saying , Child , arise . <EOV> <SOV> And her spirit returned , and immediately she rose up ; and he commanded [ something ] to eat to be given to her . <EOV> <SOV> And her parents were amazed ; but he enjoined them to tell no one what had happened . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having called together the twelve , he gave them power and authority over all demons , and to heal diseases , <EOV> <SOV> and sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take nothing for the way , neither staff , nor scrip , nor bread , nor money ; nor to have two body - coats apiece . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever house ye enter , there abide and thence go forth . <EOV> <SOV> And as many as may not receive you , going forth from that city , shake off even the dust from your feet for a witness against them . <EOV> <SOV> And going forth they passed through the villages , announcing the glad tidings and healing everywhere . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things which were done [ by him ] , and was in perplexity , because it was said by some that John was risen from among [ the ] dead , <EOV> <SOV> and by some that Elias had appeared , and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod said , John * I * have beheaded , but who is this of whom I hear such things ? and he sought to see him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles having returned related to him whatever they had done . And he took them and withdrew apart into [ a desert place of ] a city called Bethsaida . <EOV> <SOV> But the crowds knowing [ it ] followed him ; and he received them and spake to them of the kingdom of God , and cured those that had need of healing . <EOV> <SOV> But the day began to decline , and the twelve came and said to him , Send away the crowd that they may go into the villages around , and [ into ] the fields , and lodge and find victuals , for here we are in a desert place . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Give * ye them to eat . And they said , We have not more than five loaves and two fishes , unless * we * should go and buy food for all this people ; <EOV> <SOV> for they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down in companies by fifties . <EOV> <SOV> And they did so , and made them all sit down . <EOV> <SOV> And taking the five loaves and the two fishes , looking up to heaven he blessed them , and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate and were filled ; and there was taken up of what had remained over and above to them in fragments twelve hand - baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he was praying alone , his disciples were with him , and he asked them saying , Who do the crowds say that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> But they answering said , John the baptist ; but others , Elias ; and others , that one of the old prophets has risen again . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , But * ye * , who do ye say that I am ? And Peter answering said , The Christ of God . <EOV> <SOV> But , earnestly charging them , he enjoined [ them ] to say this to no man , <EOV> <SOV> saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to [ them ] all , If any one will come after me , let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me ; <EOV> <SOV> for whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it , but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake , * he * shall save it . <EOV> <SOV> For what shall a man profit if he shall have gained the whole world , and have destroyed , or come under the penalty of the loss of himself ? <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall have been ashamed of me and of my words , of him will the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his glory , and [ in that ] of the Father , and of the holy angels . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you of a truth , There are some of those standing here who shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass after these words , about eight days , that taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And as he prayed the fashion of his countenance became different and his raiment white [ and ] effulgent . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , two men talked with him , who were Moses and Elias , <EOV> <SOV> who , appearing in glory , spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter and those with him were oppressed with sleep : but having fully awoke up they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as they departed from him , Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here ; and let us make three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said . <EOV> <SOV> But as he was saying these things , there came a cloud and overshadowed them , and they feared as they entered into the cloud : <EOV> <SOV> and there was a voice out of the cloud saying , * This * is my beloved Son : hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And as the voice was [ heard ] Jesus was found alone : and * they * kept silence , and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on the following day , when they came down from the mountain , a great crowd met him . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , a man from the crowd cried out saying , Teacher , I beseech thee look upon my son , for he is mine only child : <EOV> <SOV> and behold , a spirit takes him , and suddenly he cries out , and it tears him with foaming , and with difficulty departs from him after crushing him . <EOV> <SOV> And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out , and they could not . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , O unbelieving and perverted generation , how long shall I be with you and suffer you ? Bring hither thy son . <EOV> <SOV> But as he was yet coming , the demon tore him and dragged him all together . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child and gave him back to his father . <EOV> <SOV> And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God . And as all wondered at all the things which [ Jesus ] did , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Do * ye * let these words sink into your ears . For the Son of man is about to be delivered into men 's hands . <EOV> <SOV> But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it . And they feared to ask him concerning this saying . <EOV> <SOV> And a reasoning came in amongst them , who should be [ the ] greatest of them . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , seeing the reasoning of their heart , having taken a little child set it by him , <EOV> <SOV> and said to them , Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me , and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me . For he who is the least among you all , * he * is great . <EOV> <SOV> And John answering said , Master , we saw some one casting out demons in thy name , and we forbad him , because he follows not with us . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Forbid [ him ] not , for he that is not against you is for you . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled , that * he * stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent messengers before his face . And having gone they entered into a village of the Samaritans that they might make ready for him . <EOV> <SOV> And they did not receive him , because his face was [ turned as ] going to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples James and John seeing [ it ] said , Lord , wilt thou that we speak [ that ] fire come down from heaven and consume them , as also Elias did ? <EOV> <SOV> But turning he rebuked them [ and said , Ye know not of what spirit ye are ] . <EOV> <SOV> And they went to another village . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as they went in the way , one said to him , I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest , Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting - places , but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , allow me to go first and bury my father . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Suffer the dead to bury their own dead , but do * thou * go and announce the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And another also said , I will follow thee , Lord , but first allow me to bid adieu to those at my house . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , No one having laid his hand on [ the ] plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , The harvest indeed [ is ] great , but the workmen few ; supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest that he may send out workmen into his harvest . <EOV> <SOV> Go : behold * I * send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves . <EOV> <SOV> Carry neither purse nor scrip nor sandals , and salute no one on the way . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace to this house . <EOV> <SOV> And if a son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it ; but if not it shall turn to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And in the same house abide , eating and drinking such things as they have ; for the workman is worthy of his hire . Remove not from house to house . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever city ye may enter and they receive you , eat what is set before you , <EOV> <SOV> and heal the sick in it , and say to them , The kingdom of God is come nigh to you . <EOV> <SOV> But into whatsoever city ye may have entered and they do not receive you , go out into its streets and say , <EOV> <SOV> Even the dust of your city , which cleaves to us on the feet , do we shake off against you ; but know this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to thee , Chorazin ! woe to thee , Bethsaida ! for if the works of power which have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon , they had long ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes . <EOV> <SOV> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And * thou * , Capernaum , who hast been raised up to heaven , shalt be brought down even to hades . <EOV> <SOV> He that hears you hears me ; and he that rejects you rejects me ; and he that rejects me rejects him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the seventy returned with joy , saying , Lord , even the demons are subject to us through thy name . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I give you the power of treading upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy , and nothing shall in anywise injure you . <EOV> <SOV> Yet in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subjected to you , but rejoice that your names are written in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> In the same hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said , I praise thee , Father , Lord of the heaven and of the earth , that thou hast hid these things from wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to babes : yea , Father , for thus has it been well - pleasing in thy sight . <EOV> <SOV> All things have been delivered to me by my Father , and no one knows who the Son is but the Father , and who the Father is but the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son is pleased to reveal [ him ] . <EOV> <SOV> And having turned to the disciples privately he said , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye behold , and did not see [ them ] ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and did not hear [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a certain lawyer stood up tempting him , and saying , Teacher , having done what , shall I inherit life eternal ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thine understanding ; and thy neighbour as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Thou hast answered right : this do and thou shalt live . <EOV> <SOV> But he , desirous of justifying himself , said to Jesus , And who is my neighbour ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus replying said , A certain man descended from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into [ the hands of ] robbers , who also , having stripped him and inflicted wounds , went away leaving him in a half - dead state . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain priest happened to go down that way , and seeing him , passed on on the opposite side ; <EOV> <SOV> and in like manner also a Levite , being at the spot , came and looked [ at him ] and passed on on the opposite side . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain Samaritan journeying came to him , and seeing [ him ] , was moved with compassion , <EOV> <SOV> and came up [ to him ] and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine ; and having put him on his own beast , took him to [ the ] inn and took care of him . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow [ as he left ] , taking out two denarii he gave them to the innkeeper , and said to him , Take care of him , and whatsoever thou shalt expend more , * I * will render to thee on my coming back . <EOV> <SOV> Which [ now ] of these three seems to thee to have been neighbour of him who fell into [ the hands of ] the robbers ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , He that shewed him mercy . And Jesus said to him , Go , and do * thou * likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as they went that * he * entered into a certain village ; and a certain woman , Martha by name , received him into her house . <EOV> <SOV> And she had a sister called Mary , who also , having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word . <EOV> <SOV> Now Martha was distracted with much serving , and coming up she said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone ? Speak to her therefore that she may help me . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answering said to her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things ; <EOV> <SOV> but there is need of one , and Mary has chosen the good part , the which shall not be taken from her . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass as he was in a certain place praying , when he ceased , one of his disciples said to him , Lord , teach us to pray , even as John also taught his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , When ye pray , say , Father , thy name be hallowed ; thy kingdom come ; <EOV> <SOV> give us our needed bread for each day ; <EOV> <SOV> and remit us our sins , for we also remit to every one indebted to us ; and lead us not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Who among you shall have a friend , and shall go to him at midnight and say to him , Friend , let me have three loaves , <EOV> <SOV> since a friend of mine on a journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ; <EOV> <SOV> and he within answering should say , Do not disturb me ; the door is already shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise up to give [ it ] thee ? <EOV> <SOV> -- I say to you , Although he will not get up and give [ them ] to him because he is his friend , because of his shamelessness , at any rate , he will rise and give him as many as he wants . <EOV> <SOV> And * I * say to you , Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that asks receives ; and he that seeks finds ; and to him that knocks it will be opened . <EOV> <SOV> But of whom of you that is a father shall a son ask bread , and [ the father ] shall give him a stone ? or also a fish , and instead of a fish shall give him a serpent ? <EOV> <SOV> or if also he shall ask an egg , shall give him a scorpion ? <EOV> <SOV> If therefore * ye * , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much rather shall the Father who is of heaven give [ the ] Holy Spirit to them that ask him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he was casting out a demon , and it was dumb ; and it came to pass , the demon being gone out , the dumb [ man ] spoke . And the crowds wondered . <EOV> <SOV> But some from among them said , By Beelzebub the prince of the demons casts he out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And others tempting [ him ] sought from him a sign out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But * he * , knowing their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation : and a house set against a house falls ; <EOV> <SOV> and if also Satan is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom subsist ? because ye say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub . <EOV> <SOV> But if * I * by Beelzebub cast out demons , your sons -- by whom do they cast [ them ] out ? For this reason * they * shall be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if by the finger of God I cast out demons , then the kingdom of God is come upon you . <EOV> <SOV> When the strong [ man ] armed keeps his own house , his goods are in peace ; <EOV> <SOV> but when the stronger than he coming upon [ him ] overcomes him , he takes away his panoply in which he trusted , and he will divide the spoil [ he has taken ] from him . <EOV> <SOV> He that is not with me is against me , and he that gathers not with me scatters . <EOV> <SOV> When the unclean spirit has gone out of the man , he goes through dry places seeking rest ; and not finding [ any ] he says , I will return to my house whence I came out . <EOV> <SOV> And having come , he finds it swept and adorned . <EOV> <SOV> Then he goes and takes seven other spirits worse than himself , and entering in , they dwell there ; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he spake these things , a certain woman , lifting up her voice out of the crowd , said to him , Blessed is the womb that has borne thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked . <EOV> <SOV> But * he * said , Yea rather , blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> But as the crowds thronged together , he began to say , This generation is a wicked generation : it seeks a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it but the sign of Jonas . <EOV> <SOV> For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites , thus shall also the Son of man be to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , more than Solomon is here . <EOV> <SOV> Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and behold , more than Jonas is here . <EOV> <SOV> But no one having lit a lamp sets it in secret , nor under the corn - measure , but on the lamp - stand , that they who enter in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> The lamp of the body is thine eye : when thine eye is simple , thy whole body also is light ; but when it is wicked , thy body also is dark . <EOV> <SOV> See therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore thy whole body [ is ] light , not having any part dark , it shall be all light as when the lamp lights thee with its brightness . <EOV> <SOV> But as he spoke , a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him ; and entering in he placed himself at table . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisee seeing [ it ] wondered that he had not first washed before dinner . <EOV> <SOV> But the Lord said to him , Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish , but your inward [ parts ] are full of plunder and wickedness . <EOV> <SOV> Fools , has not he who has made the outside made the inside also ? <EOV> <SOV> But rather give alms of what ye have , and behold , all things are clean to you . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto you , Pharisees , for ye pay tithes of mint and rue and every herb , and pass by the judgment and the love of God : these ye ought to have done , and not have left those aside . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , Pharisees , for ye love the first seat in the synagogues and salutations in the market - places . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , for ye are as the sepulchres which appear not , and the men walking over them do not know [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the doctors of the law answering says to him , Teacher , in saying these things thou insultest us also . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , To you also woe , doctors of the law , for ye lay upon men burdens heavy to bear , and yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , but your fathers killed them . <EOV> <SOV> Ye bear witness then , and consent to the works of your fathers ; for * they * killed them , and * ye * build [ their sepulchres ] . <EOV> <SOV> For this reason also the wisdom of God has said , I will send to them prophets and apostles , and of these shall they kill and drive out by persecution , <EOV> <SOV> that the blood of all the prophets which has been poured out from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation , <EOV> <SOV> from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias , who perished between the altar and the house ; yea , I say to you , it shall be required of this generation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , the doctors of the law , for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ; yourselves have not entered in , and those who were entering in ye have hindered . <EOV> <SOV> And as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him urgently , and to make him speak of many things ; <EOV> <SOV> watching him , [ and seeking ] to catch something out of his mouth , [ that they might accuse him ] . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In those [ times ] , the myriads of the crowd being gathered together , so that they trod one on another , he began to say to his disciples first , Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy ; <EOV> <SOV> but there is nothing covered up which shall not be revealed , nor secret that shall not be known ; <EOV> <SOV> therefore whatever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light , and what ye have spoken in the ear in chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , my friends , Fear not those who kill the body and after this have no more that they can do . <EOV> <SOV> But I will shew you whom ye shall fear : Fear him who after he has killed has authority to cast into hell ; yea , I say to you , Fear * him*. <EOV> <SOV> Are not five sparrows sold for two assaria ? and one of them is not forgotten before God . <EOV> <SOV> But even the hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore , ye are better than many sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , the Son of man will confess him also before the angels of God ; <EOV> <SOV> but he that shall have denied me before men shall be denied before the angels of God ; <EOV> <SOV> and whoever shall say a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him ; but to him that speaks injuriously against the Holy Spirit it shall not be forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> But when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and the authorities , be not careful how or what ye shall answer , or what ye shall say ; <EOV> <SOV> for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the hour itself what should be said . <EOV> <SOV> And a person said to him out of the crowd , Teacher , speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to him , Man , who established me [ as ] a judge or a divider over you ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take heed and keep yourselves from all covetousness , for [ it is ] not because a man is in abundance [ that ] his life is in his possessions . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke a parable to them , saying , The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly . <EOV> <SOV> And he reasoned within himself saying , What shall I do ? for I have not [ a place ] where I shall lay up my fruits . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , This will I do : I will take away my granaries and build greater , and there I will lay up all my produce and my good things ; <EOV> <SOV> and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much good things laid by for many years ; repose thyself , eat , drink , be merry . <EOV> <SOV> But God said to him , Fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee ; and whose shall be what thou hast prepared ? <EOV> <SOV> Thus is he who lays up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to his disciples , For this cause I say unto you , Be not careful for life , what ye shall eat , nor for the body , what ye shall put on . <EOV> <SOV> The life is more than food , and the body than raiment . <EOV> <SOV> Consider the ravens , that they sow not nor reap ; which have neither storehouse nor granary ; and God feeds them . How much better are * ye * than the birds ? <EOV> <SOV> But which of you by being careful can add to his stature one cubit ? <EOV> <SOV> If therefore ye can not [ do ] even what is least , why are ye careful about the rest ? <EOV> <SOV> Consider the lilies how they grow : they neither toil nor spin ; but I say unto you , Not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these . <EOV> <SOV> But if God thus clothe the grass , which to - day is in the field and to - morrow is cast into [ the ] oven , how much rather you , O ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And * ye * , seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink , and be not in anxiety ; <EOV> <SOV> for all these things do the nations of the world seek after , and your Father knows that ye have need of these things ; <EOV> <SOV> but seek his kingdom , and [ all ] these things shall be added to you . <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , little flock , for it has been the good pleasure of your Father to give you the kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> Sell what ye possess and give alms ; make to yourselves purses which do not grow old , a treasure which does not fail in the heavens , where thief does not draw near nor moth destroy . <EOV> <SOV> For where your treasure is , there also will your heart be . <EOV> <SOV> Let your loins be girded about , and lamps burning ; <EOV> <SOV> and * ye * like men who wait their own lord whenever he may leave the wedding , that when he comes and knocks , they may open to him immediately . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are those bondmen whom the lord [ on ] coming shall find watching ; verily I say unto you , that he will gird himself and make them recline at table , and coming up will serve them . <EOV> <SOV> And if he come in the second watch , and come in the third watch , and find [ them ] thus , blessed are those [ bondmen ] . <EOV> <SOV> But this know , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be dug through . <EOV> <SOV> And ye therefore , be * ye * ready , for in the hour in which ye do not think [ it ] , the Son of man comes . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said to him , Lord , sayest thou this parable to us , or also to all ? <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Who then is the faithful and prudent steward , whom his lord will set over his household , to give the measure of corn in season ? <EOV> <SOV> Blessed is that bondman whom his lord [ on ] coming shall find doing thus ; <EOV> <SOV> verily I say unto you , that he will set him over all that he has . <EOV> <SOV> But if that bondman should say in his heart , My lord delays to come , and begin to beat the menservants and the maidservants , and to eat and to drink and to be drunken , <EOV> <SOV> the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does not expect it , and in an hour he knows not of , and shall cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unbelievers . <EOV> <SOV> But that bondman who knew his own lord 's will , and had not prepared [ himself ] nor done his will , shall be beaten with many [ stripes ] ; <EOV> <SOV> but he who knew [ it ] not , and did things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few . And to every one to whom much has been given , much shall be required from him ; and to whom [ men ] have committed much , they will ask from him the more . <EOV> <SOV> I have come to cast a fire on the earth ; and what will I if already it has been kindled ? <EOV> <SOV> But I have a baptism to be baptised with , and how am I straitened until it shall have been accomplished ! <EOV> <SOV> Think ye that I have come to give peace in the earth ? Nay , I say to you , but rather division : <EOV> <SOV> for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided ; three shall be divided against two , and two against three : <EOV> <SOV> father against son , and son against father ; mother against daughter , and daughter against mother ; a mother - in - law against her daughter - in - law , and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law . <EOV> <SOV> And he said also to the crowds , When ye see a cloud rising out of the west , straightway ye say , A shower is coming ; and so it happens . <EOV> <SOV> And when [ ye see ] the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it happens . <EOV> <SOV> Hypocrites , ye know how to judge of the appearance of the earth and of the heaven ; how [ is it then that ] ye do not discern this time ? <EOV> <SOV> And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ? <EOV> <SOV> For as thou goest with thine adverse party before a magistrate , strive in the way to be reconciled with him , lest he drag thee away to the judge , and the judge shall deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto thee , Thou shalt in no wise come out thence until thou hast paid the very last mite . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now at the same time there were present some who told him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with [ that of ] their sacrifices . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , Think ye that these Galileans were sinners beyond all the Galileans because they suffered such things ? <EOV> <SOV> No , I say to you , but if ye repent not , ye shall all perish in the same manner . <EOV> <SOV> Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them , think ye that * they * were debtors beyond all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ? <EOV> <SOV> No , I say to you , but if ye repent not , ye shall all perish in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke this parable : A certain [ man ] had a fig - tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit upon it and did not find [ any ] . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the vinedresser , Behold , [ these ] three years I come seeking fruit on this fig - tree and find none : cut it down ; why does it also render the ground useless ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answering says to him , Sir , let it alone for this year also , until I shall dig about it and put dung , <EOV> <SOV> and if it shall bear fruit -- but if not , after that thou shalt cut it down . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , [ there was ] a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and she was bent together and wholly unable to lift her head up . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , seeing her , called to [ her ] , and said to her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity . <EOV> <SOV> And he laid his hands upon her ; and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God . <EOV> <SOV> But the ruler of the synagogue , indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath , answering said to the crowd , There are six days in which [ people ] ought to work ; in these therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day . <EOV> <SOV> The Lord therefore answered him and said , Hypocrites ! does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger and leading [ it ] away , water [ it ] ? <EOV> <SOV> And this [ woman ] , who is a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound , lo , [ these ] eighteen years , ought she not to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> And as he said these things , all who were opposed to him were ashamed ; and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things which were being done by him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , To what is the kingdom of God like ? and to what shall I liken it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like a grain of mustard [ seed ] which a man took and cast into his garden ; and it grew and became a great tree , and the birds of heaven lodged in its branches . <EOV> <SOV> And again he said , To what shall I liken the kingdom of God ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened . <EOV> <SOV> And he went through one city and village after another , teaching , and journeying to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And one said to him , Sir , [ are ] such as are to be saved few in number ? But he said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> Strive with earnestness to enter in through the narrow door , for many , I say to you , will seek to enter in and will not be able . <EOV> <SOV> From the time that the master of the house shall have risen up and shall have shut the door , and ye shall begin to stand without and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , open to us ; and he answering shall say to you , I know you not whence ye are : <EOV> <SOV> then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten in thy presence and drunk , and thou hast taught in our streets ; <EOV> <SOV> and he shall say , I tell you , I do not know you whence ye are ; depart from me , all [ ye ] workers of iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , but yourselves cast out . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall come from east and west , and from north and south , and shall lie down at table in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last . <EOV> <SOV> The same hour certain Pharisees came up , saying to him , Get out , and go hence , for Herod is desirous to kill thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Go , tell that fox , Behold , I cast out demons and accomplish cures to - day and to - morrow , and the third [ day ] I am perfected ; <EOV> <SOV> but I must needs walk to - day and to - morrow and the [ day ] following , for it must not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Jerusalem , Jerusalem , the [ city ] that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her , how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen her brood under her wings , and ye would not . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , your house is left unto you ; and I say unto you , that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say , Blessed [ is ] he that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the rulers , [ who was ] of the Pharisees , to eat bread on [ the ] sabbath , that * they * were watching him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a certain dropsical [ man ] before him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering spoke unto the doctors of the law and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> But they were silent . And taking him he healed him and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> And answering he said to them , Of which of you shall an ass or ox fall into a well , that he does not straightway pull him up on the sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> And they were not able to answer him to these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke a parable to those that were invited , remarking how they chose out the first places , saying to them , <EOV> <SOV> When thou art invited by any one to a wedding , do not lay thyself down in the first place at table , lest perhaps a more honourable than thou be invited by him , <EOV> <SOV> and he who invited thee and him come and say to thee , Give place to this [ man ] , and then thou begin with shame to take the last place . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou hast been invited , go and put thyself down in the last place , that when he who has invited thee comes , he may say to thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have honour before all that are lying at table with thee ; <EOV> <SOV> for every one that exalts himself shall be abased , and he that abases himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> And he said also to him that had invited him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , nor thy kinsfolk , nor rich neighbours , lest it may be they also should invite thee in return , and a recompense be made thee . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou makest a feast , call poor , crippled , lame , blind : <EOV> <SOV> and thou shalt be blessed ; for they have not [ the means ] to recompense thee ; for it shall be recompensed thee in the resurrection of the just . <EOV> <SOV> And one of those that were lying at table with [ them ] , hearing these things , said to him , Blessed [ is ] he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , A certain man made a great supper and invited many . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent his bondman at the hour of supper to say to those who were invited , Come , for already all things are ready . <EOV> <SOV> And all began , without exception , to excuse themselves . The first said to him , I have bought land , and I must go out and see it ; I pray thee hold me for excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them ; I pray thee hold me for excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have married a wife , and on this account I can not come . <EOV> <SOV> And the bondman came up and brought back word of these things to his lord . Then the master of the house , in anger , said to his bondman , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring here the poor and crippled and lame and blind . <EOV> <SOV> And the bondman said , Sir , it is done as thou hast commanded , and there is still room . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord said to the bondman , Go out into the ways and fences and compel to come in , that my house may be filled ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , that not one of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper . <EOV> <SOV> And great crowds went with him ; and , turning round , he said to them , <EOV> <SOV> If any man come to me , and shall not hate his own father and mother , and wife , and children , and brothers , and sisters , yea , and his own life too , he can not be my disciple ; <EOV> <SOV> and whoever does not carry his cross and come after me can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> For which of you , desirous of building a tower , does not first sit down and count the cost , if he have what [ is needed ] to complete it ; <EOV> <SOV> in order that , having laid the foundation of it , and not being able to finish it , all who see it do not begin to mock at him , <EOV> <SOV> saying , This man began to build and was not able to finish ? <EOV> <SOV> Or what king , going on his way to engage in war with another king , does not , sitting down first , take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him coming against him with twenty thousand ? <EOV> <SOV> and if not , while he is yet far off , having sent an embassy , he asks for terms of peace . <EOV> <SOV> Thus then every one of you who forsakes not all that is his own can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> Salt [ then ] [ is ] good , but if the salt also has become savourless , wherewith shall it be seasoned ? <EOV> <SOV> It is proper neither for land nor for dung ; it is cast out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And all the tax - gatherers and the sinners were coming near to him to hear him ; <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured , saying , This [ man ] receives sinners and eats with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke to them this parable , saying , <EOV> <SOV> What man of you having a hundred sheep , and having lost one of them , does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost , until he find it ? <EOV> <SOV> and having found it , he lays it upon his own shoulders , rejoicing ; <EOV> <SOV> and being come to the house , calls together the friends and the neighbours , saying to them , Rejoice with me , for I have found my lost sheep . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , that thus there shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner , [ more ] than for ninety and nine righteous who have no need of repentance . <EOV> <SOV> Or , what woman having ten drachmas , if she lose one drachma , does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it ? <EOV> <SOV> and having found it she calls together the friends and neighbours , saying , Rejoice with me , for I have found the drachma which I had lost . <EOV> <SOV> Thus , I say unto you , there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A certain man had two sons ; <EOV> <SOV> and the younger of them said to his father , Father , give to me the share of the property that falls [ to me ] . And he divided to them what he was possessed of . <EOV> <SOV> And after not many days the younger son gathering all together went away into a country a long way off , and there dissipated his property , living in debauchery . <EOV> <SOV> But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine throughout that country , and he began to be in want . <EOV> <SOV> And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him into his fields to feed swine . <EOV> <SOV> And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were eating ; and no one gave to him . <EOV> <SOV> And coming to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have abundance of bread , and * I * perish here by famine . <EOV> <SOV> I will rise up and go to my father , and I will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and before thee ; <EOV> <SOV> I am no longer worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants . <EOV> <SOV> And he rose up and went to his own father . But while he was yet a long way off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell upon his neck , and covered him with kisses . <EOV> <SOV> And the son said to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven and before thee ; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son . <EOV> <SOV> But the father said to his bondmen , Bring out the best robe and clothe him in [ it ] , and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet ; <EOV> <SOV> and bring the fatted calf and kill it , and let us eat and make merry : <EOV> <SOV> for this my son was dead and has come to life , was lost and has been found . And they began to make merry . <EOV> <SOV> And his elder son was in the field ; and as , coming [ up ] , he drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing . <EOV> <SOV> And having called one of the servants , he inquired what these things might be . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Thy brother is come , and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and well . <EOV> <SOV> But he became angry and would not go in . And his father went out and besought him . <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said to his father , Behold , so many years I serve thee , and never have I transgressed a commandment of thine ; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends : <EOV> <SOV> but when this thy son , who has devoured thy substance with harlots , is come , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to him , Child , * thou * art ever with me , and all that is mine is thine . <EOV> <SOV> But it was right to make merry and rejoice , because this thy brother was dead and has come to life again , and was lost and has been found . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said also to [ his ] disciples , There was a certain rich man who had a steward , and * he * was accused to him as wasting his goods . <EOV> <SOV> And having called him , he said to him , What [ is ] this that I hear of thee ? give the reckoning of thy stewardship , for thou canst be no longer steward . <EOV> <SOV> And the steward said within himself , What shall I do ; for my lord is taking the stewardship from me ? I am not able to dig ; I am ashamed to beg . <EOV> <SOV> I know what I will do , that when I shall have been removed from the stewardship I may be received into their houses . <EOV> <SOV> And having called to [ him ] each one of the debtors of his own lord , he said to the first , How much owest thou to my lord ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A hundred baths of oil . And he said to him , Take thy writing and sit down quickly and write fifty . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said to another , And thou , how much dost thou owe ? And he said , A hundred cors of wheat . And he says to him , Take thy writing and write eighty . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord praised the unrighteous steward because he had done prudently . For the sons of this world are , for their own generation , more prudent than the sons of light . <EOV> <SOV> And * I * say to you , Make to yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness , that when it fails ye may be received into the eternal tabernacles . <EOV> <SOV> He that is faithful in the least is faithful also in much ; and he that is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who shall entrust to you the true ? <EOV> <SOV> and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another 's , who shall give to you your own ? <EOV> <SOV> No servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and will love the other , or he will cleave to the one and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things , and mocked him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , * Ye * are they who justify themselves before men , but God knows your hearts ; for what amongst men is highly thought of is an abomination before God . <EOV> <SOV> The law and the prophets [ were ] until John : from that time the glad tidings of the kingdom of God are announced , and every one forces his way into it . <EOV> <SOV> But it is easier that the heaven and the earth should pass away than that one tittle of the law should fail . <EOV> <SOV> Every one who puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery ; and every one that marries one put away from a husband commits adultery . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was a rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen , making good cheer in splendour every day . <EOV> <SOV> And [ there was ] a poor man , by name Lazarus , [ who ] was laid at his gateway full of sores , <EOV> <SOV> and desiring to be filled with the crumbs which fell from the table of the rich man ; but the dogs also coming licked his sores . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass that the poor man died , and that he was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham . And the rich man also died and was buried . <EOV> <SOV> And in hades lifting up his eyes , being in torments , he sees Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom . <EOV> <SOV> And he crying out said , Father Abraham , have compassion on me , and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am suffering in this flame . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham said , Child , recollect that * thou * hast fully received thy good things in thy lifetime , and likewise Lazarus evil things . But now he is comforted here , and * thou * art in suffering . <EOV> <SOV> And besides all this , between us and you a great chasm is fixed , so that those who desire to pass hence to you can not , nor do they who [ desire to cross ] from there pass over unto us . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I beseech thee then , father , that thou wouldest send him to the house of my father , <EOV> <SOV> for I have five brothers , so that he may earnestly testify to them , that they also may not come to this place of torment . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham says to him , They have Moses and the prophets : let them hear them . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Nay , father Abraham , but if one from the dead should go to them , they will repent . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , not even if one rise from among [ the ] dead will they be persuaded . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said to his disciples , It can not be but that offences come , but woe [ to him ] by whom they come ! <EOV> <SOV> It would be [ more ] profitable for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea , than that he should be a snare to one of these little ones . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed to yourselves : if thy brother should sin , rebuke him ; and if he should repent , forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day , and seven times should return to thee , saying , I repent , thou shalt forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles said to the Lord , Give more faith to us . <EOV> <SOV> But the Lord said , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [ seed ] , ye had said to this sycamine tree , Be thou rooted up , and be thou planted in the sea , and it would have obeyed you . <EOV> <SOV> But which of you [ is there ] who , having a bondman ploughing or shepherding , when he comes in out of the field , will say , Come and lie down immediately to table ? <EOV> <SOV> But will he not say to him , Prepare what I shall sup on , and gird thyself and serve me that I may eat and drink ; and after that * thou * shalt eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> Is he thankful to the bondman because he has done what was ordered ? I judge not . <EOV> <SOV> Thus * ye * also , when ye shall have done all things that have been ordered you , say , We are unprofitable bondmen ; we have done what it was our duty to do . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he was going up to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And as he entered into a certain village ten leprous men met him , who stood afar off . <EOV> <SOV> And they lifted up [ their ] voice saying , Jesus , Master , have compassion on us . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing [ them ] he said to them , Go , shew yourselves to the priests . And it came to pass as they were going they were cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , seeing that he was cured , turned back , glorifying God with a loud voice , <EOV> <SOV> and fell on [ his ] face at his feet giving him thanks : and * he * was a Samaritan . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , Were not the ten cleansed ? but the nine , where [ are they ] ? <EOV> <SOV> There have not been found to return and give glory to God save this stranger . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Rise up and go thy way : thy faith has made thee well . <EOV> <SOV> And having been asked by the Pharisees , When is the kingdom of God coming ? he answered them and said , The kingdom of God does not come with observation ; <EOV> <SOV> nor shall they say , Lo here , or , Lo there ; for behold , the kingdom of God is in the midst of you . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the disciples , Days are coming , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and shall not see [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And they will say to you , Lo here , or Lo there ; go not , nor follow [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> For as the lightning shines which lightens from [ one end ] under heaven to [ the other end ] under heaven , thus shall the Son of man be in his day . <EOV> <SOV> But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And as it took place in the days of Noe , thus also shall it be in the days of the Son of man : <EOV> <SOV> they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came and destroyed all [ of them ] ; <EOV> <SOV> and in like manner as took place in the days of Lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ; <EOV> <SOV> but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom , it rained fire and sulphur from heaven , and destroyed all [ of them ] : <EOV> <SOV> after this [ manner ] shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed . <EOV> <SOV> In that day , he who shall be on the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not go down to take it away ; and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back . <EOV> <SOV> Remember the wife of Lot . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it , and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , In that night there shall be two [ men ] upon one bed ; one shall be seized and the other shall be let go . <EOV> <SOV> Two [ women ] shall be grinding together ; the one shall be seized and the other shall be let go . <EOV> <SOV> [ Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be seized and the other let go . ] <EOV> <SOV> And answering they say to him , Where , Lord ? And he said to them , Where the body [ is ] , there the eagles will be gathered together . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he spoke also a parable to them to the purport that they should always pray and not faint , <EOV> <SOV> saying , There was a judge in a city , not fearing God and not respecting man : <EOV> <SOV> and there was a widow in that city , and she came to him , saying , Avenge me of mine adverse party . <EOV> <SOV> And he would not for a time ; but afterwards he said within himself , If even I fear not God and respect not man , <EOV> <SOV> at any rate because this widow annoys me I will avenge her , that she may not by perpetually coming completely harass me . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge says . <EOV> <SOV> And shall not God at all avenge his elect , who cry to him day and night , and he bears long as to them ? <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you that he will avenge them speedily . But when the Son of man comes , shall he indeed find faith on the earth ? <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke also to some , who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [ of men ] , this parable : <EOV> <SOV> Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a tax - gatherer . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisee , standing , prayed thus to himself : God , I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men , rapacious , unjust , adulterers , or even as this tax - gatherer . <EOV> <SOV> I fast twice in the week , I tithe everything I gain . <EOV> <SOV> And the tax - gatherer , standing afar off , would not lift up even his eyes to heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , O God , have compassion on me , the sinner . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , This [ man ] went down to his house justified rather than that [ other ] . For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled , and he that humbles himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them , but the disciples when they saw [ it ] rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus calling them to [ him ] said , Suffer little children to come to me , and do not forbid them , for of such is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain ruler asked him saying , Good teacher , having done what , shall I inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ? There is none good but one , God . <EOV> <SOV> Thou knowest the commandments : Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , All these things have I kept from my youth . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had heard this , he said to him , One thing is lacking to thee yet : Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens , and come , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> But when he heard this he became very sorrowful , for he was very rich . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful , he said , How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God ; <EOV> <SOV> for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle 's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And those who heard it said , And who can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> But he said , The things that are impossible with men are possible with God . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , Behold , * we * have left all things and have followed thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Verily I say to you , There is no one who has left home , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake , <EOV> <SOV> who shall not receive manifold more at this time , and in the coming age life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the twelve to [ him ] and said to them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written of the Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished ; <EOV> <SOV> for he shall be delivered up to the nations , and shall be mocked , and insulted , and spit upon . <EOV> <SOV> And when they have scourged [ him ] they will kill him ; and on the third day he will rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And they understood nothing of these things . And this word was hidden from them , and they did not know what was said . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard the crowd passing , he inquired what this might be . <EOV> <SOV> And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by . <EOV> <SOV> And he called out saying , Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And those [ who were ] going before rebuked him that he might be silent ; but * he * cried out so much the more , Son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be led to him . And when he drew nigh he asked him [ saying ] , <EOV> <SOV> What wilt thou that I shall do to thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may see . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , See : thy faith has healed thee . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he saw , and followed him , glorifying God . And all the people when they saw [ it ] gave praise to God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered and passed through Jericho . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , [ there was ] a man by name called Zacchaeus , and he was chief tax - gatherer , and he was rich . <EOV> <SOV> And he sought to see Jesus who he was : and he could not for the crowd , because he was little in stature . <EOV> <SOV> And running on before , he got up into a sycamore that he might see him , for he was going to pass that [ way ] . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came up to the place , Jesus looked up and saw him , and said to him , Zacchaeus , make haste and come down , for to - day I must remain in thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he made haste and came down , and received him with joy . <EOV> <SOV> And all murmured when they saw [ it ] , saying , He has turned in to lodge with a sinful man . <EOV> <SOV> But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord , Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor , and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation , I return [ him ] fourfold . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , To - day salvation is come to this house , inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham ; <EOV> <SOV> for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost . <EOV> <SOV> But as they were listening to these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was near to Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to be immediately manifested . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore , A certain high - born man went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and return . <EOV> <SOV> And having called his own ten bondmen , he gave to them ten minas , and said to them , Trade while I am coming . <EOV> <SOV> But his citizens hated him , and sent an embassy after him , saying , We will not that this [ man ] should reign over us . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on his arrival back again , having received the kingdom , that he desired these bondmen to whom he gave the money to be called to him , in order that he might know what every one had gained by trading . <EOV> <SOV> And the first came up , saying , [ My ] Lord , thy mina has produced ten minas . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Well [ done ] , thou good bondman ; because thou hast been faithful in that which is least , be thou in authority over ten cities . <EOV> <SOV> And the second came , saying , [ My ] Lord , thy mina has made five minas . <EOV> <SOV> And he said also to this one , And * thou * , be over five cities . <EOV> <SOV> And another came , saying , [ My ] Lord , lo , [ there is ] thy mina , which I have kept laid up in a towel . <EOV> <SOV> For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man : thou takest up what thou hast not laid down , and thou reapest what thou hast not sowed . <EOV> <SOV> He says to him , Out of thy mouth will I judge thee , wicked bondman : thou knewest that * I * am a harsh man , taking up what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed . <EOV> <SOV> And why didst thou not give my money to [ the ] bank ; and * I * should have received it , at my coming , with interest ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to those that stood by , Take from him the mina and give [ it ] to him who has the ten minas . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Lord , he has ten minas . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that to every one that has shall be given ; but from him that has not , that even which he has shall be taken from him . <EOV> <SOV> Moreover those mine enemies , who would not [ have ] me to reign over them , bring them here and slay [ them ] before me . <EOV> <SOV> And having said these things , he went on before , going up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called [ the mount ] of Olives , he sent two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Go into the village over against [ you ] , in which ye will find , on entering it , a colt tied up , on which no [ child ] of man ever sat at any time : loose it and lead it [ here ] . <EOV> <SOV> And if any one ask you , Why do ye loose [ it ] ? thus shall ye say to him , Because the Lord has need of it . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were sent , having gone their way , found as he had said to them . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were loosing the colt , its masters said to them , Why loose ye the colt ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Because the Lord has need of it . <EOV> <SOV> And they led it to Jesus ; and having cast their own garments on the colt , they put Jesus on [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> And as he went , they strewed their clothes in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And as he drew near , already at the descent of the mount of Olives , all the multitude of the disciples began , rejoicing , to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Blessed the King that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him , Teacher , rebuke thy disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , I say unto you , If these shall be silent , the stones will cry out . <EOV> <SOV> And as he drew near , seeing the city , he wept over it , <EOV> <SOV> saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , even at least in this thy day , the things that are for thy peace : but now they are hid from thine eyes ; <EOV> <SOV> for days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall make a palisaded mound about thee , and shall close thee around , and keep thee in on every side , <EOV> <SOV> and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children in thee ; and shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone : because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation . <EOV> <SOV> And entering into the temple , he began to cast out those that sold and bought in it , <EOV> <SOV> saying to them , It is written , My house is a house of prayer , but * ye * have made it a den of robbers . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching day by day in the temple : and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him , <EOV> <SOV> and did not find what they could do , for all the people hung on him to hear . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass on one of the days , as he was teaching the people in the temple , and announcing the glad tidings , the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up , <EOV> <SOV> and spoke to him saying , Tell us by what authority thou doest these things , or who is it who has given thee this authority ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , * I * also will ask you [ one ] thing , and tell me : <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it of heaven or of men ? <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned among themselves , saying , If we should say , Of heaven , he will say , Why have ye not believed him ? <EOV> <SOV> but if we should say , Of men , the whole people will stone us , for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered , they did not know whence . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Neither do * I * tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to speak to the people this parable : A man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen , and left the country for a long time . <EOV> <SOV> And in the season he sent to the husbandmen a bondman , that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard ; but the husbandmen , having beaten him , sent [ him ] away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent another bondman ; but they , having beaten him also , and cast insult upon him , sent [ him ] away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent a third ; and they , having wounded him also , cast [ him ] out . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : perhaps when they see him they will respect [ him ] . <EOV> <SOV> But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; [ come , ] let us kill him , that the inheritance may become ours . <EOV> <SOV> And having cast him forth out of the vineyard , they killed [ him ] . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them ? <EOV> <SOV> He will come and destroy those husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it they said , May it never be ! <EOV> <SOV> But he looking at them said , What then is this that is written , The stone which they that builded rejected , this has become the corner - stone ? <EOV> <SOV> Every one falling on this stone shall be broken , but on whomsoever it shall fall , it shall grind him to powder . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour to lay hands on him , and they feared the people ; for they knew that he had spoken this parable of them . <EOV> <SOV> And having watched [ him ] , they sent out suborned persons , pretending to be just men , that they might take hold of him in [ his ] language , so that they might deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him saying , Teacher , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , and acceptest no [ man 's ] person , but teachest with truth the way of God : <EOV> <SOV> Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But perceiving their deceit he said to them , Why do ye tempt me ? <EOV> <SOV> Shew me a denarius . Whose image and superscription has it ? And answering they said , Caesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Pay therefore what is Caesar 's to Caesar , and what is God 's to God . <EOV> <SOV> And they were not able to take hold of him in [ his ] expressions before the people , and , wondering at his answer , they were silent . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Sadducees , who deny that there is any resurrection , coming up [ to him ] , <EOV> <SOV> demanded of him saying , Teacher , Moses wrote to us , If any one 's brother , who has a wife , die , and he die childless , his brother shall take the wife and raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> There were then seven brethren : and the first , having taken a wife , died childless ; <EOV> <SOV> and the second [ took the woman , and * he * died childless ] ; <EOV> <SOV> and the third took her : and in like manner also the seven left no children and died ; <EOV> <SOV> and last of all the woman also died . <EOV> <SOV> In the resurrection therefore of which of them does she become wife , for the seven had her as wife ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage , <EOV> <SOV> but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world , and the resurrection from among [ the ] dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ; <EOV> <SOV> for neither can they die any more , for they are equal to angels , and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection . <EOV> <SOV> But that the dead rise , even Moses shewed in [ the section of ] the bush , when he called [ the ] Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob ; <EOV> <SOV> but he is not God of [ the ] dead but of [ the ] living ; for all live for him . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the scribes answering said , Teacher , thou hast well spoken . <EOV> <SOV> For they did not dare any more to ask him anything . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , How do they say that the Christ is David 's son , <EOV> <SOV> and David himself says in the book of Psalms , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit at my right hand <EOV> <SOV> until I put thine enemies [ as ] footstool of thy feet ? <EOV> <SOV> David therefore calls him Lord , and how is he his son ? <EOV> <SOV> And , as all the people were listening , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Beware of the scribes , who like to walk about in long robes , and who love salutations in the market - places , and first seats in the synagogues , and first places at suppers ; <EOV> <SOV> who devour the houses of widows , and as a pretext make long prayers . These shall receive a severer judgment . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he looked up and saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury ; <EOV> <SOV> but he saw also a certain poor widow casting therein two mites . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Verily I say unto you , that this poor widow has cast in more than all ; <EOV> <SOV> for all these out of their abundance have cast into the gifts [ of God ] ; but she out of her need has cast in all the living which she had . <EOV> <SOV> And as some spoke of the temple , that it was adorned with goodly stones and consecrated offerings , he said , <EOV> <SOV> [ As to ] these things which ye are beholding , days are coming in which there shall not be left stone upon stone which shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him saying , Teacher , when then shall these things be ; and what [ is ] the sign when these things are going to take place ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , See that ye be not led astray , for many shall come in my name , saying , * I * am [ he ] , and the time is drawn nigh : go ye not [ therefore ] after them . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye shall hear of wars and tumults , be not terrified , for these things must first take place , but the end is not immediately . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said to them , Nation shall rise up against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; <EOV> <SOV> there shall be both great earthquakes in different places , and famines and pestilences ; and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But before all these things they shall lay their hands upon you and persecute you , delivering [ you ] up to synagogues and prisons , bringing [ you ] before kings and governors on account of my name ; <EOV> <SOV> but it shall turn out to you for a testimony . <EOV> <SOV> Settle therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand [ your ] defence , <EOV> <SOV> for * I * will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your opposers shall not be able to reply to or resist . <EOV> <SOV> But ye will be delivered up even by parents and brethren and relations and friends , and they shall put to death [ some ] from among you , <EOV> <SOV> and ye will be hated of all for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> And a hair of your head shall in no wise perish . <EOV> <SOV> By your patient endurance gain your souls . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye see Jerusalem encompassed with armies , then know that its desolation is drawn nigh . <EOV> <SOV> Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains , and those who are in the midst of it depart out , and those who are in the country not enter into it ; <EOV> <SOV> for these are days of avenging , that all the things that are written may be accomplished . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to them that are with child and to them who give suck in those days , for there shall be great distress upon the land and wrath upon this people . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and be led captive into all the nations ; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of [ the ] nations until [ the ] times of [ the ] nations be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars , and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity [ at ] the roar of the sea and rolling waves , <EOV> <SOV> men ready to die through fear and expectation of what is coming on the habitable earth , for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> But when these things begin to come to pass , look up and lift up your heads , because your redemption draws nigh . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke a parable to them : Behold the fig - tree and all the trees ; <EOV> <SOV> when they already sprout , ye know of your own selves , [ on ] looking [ at them ] , that already the summer is near . <EOV> <SOV> So also * ye * , when ye see these things take place , know that the kingdom of God is near . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall in no wise pass away until all come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall in no wise pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But take heed to yourselves lest possibly your hearts be laden with surfeiting and drinking and cares of life , and that day come upon you suddenly unawares ; <EOV> <SOV> for as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the whole earth . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore , praying at every season , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things which are about to come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> And by day he was teaching in the temple , and by night , going out , he remained abroad on the mountain called [ the mount ] of Olives ; <EOV> <SOV> and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now the feast of unleavened bread , which [ is ] called the passover , drew nigh , <EOV> <SOV> and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people . <EOV> <SOV> And Satan entered into Judas , who was surnamed Iscariote , being of the number of the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And he went away and spoke with the chief priests and captains as to how he should deliver him up to them . <EOV> <SOV> And they were rejoiced , and agreed to give him money . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to an agreement to do it , and sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them away from the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> And the day of unleavened bread came , in which the passover was to be killed . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare the passover for us , that we may eat [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> But they said to him , Where wilt thou that we prepare [ it ] ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Behold , as ye enter into the city a man will meet you , carrying an earthen pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he goes in ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall say to the master of the house , The Teacher says to thee , Where is the guest - chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And * he * will shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready . <EOV> <SOV> And having gone they found it as he had said to them ; and they prepared the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when the hour was come , he placed himself at table , and the [ twelve ] apostles with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that I will not eat any more at all of it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And having received a cup , when he had given thanks he said , Take this and divide it among yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that I will not drink at all of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken a loaf , when he had given thanks , he broke [ it ] , and gave [ it ] to them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me . <EOV> <SOV> In like manner also the cup , after having supped , saying , This cup [ is ] the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you . <EOV> <SOV> Moreover , behold , the hand of him that delivers me up [ is ] with me on the table ; <EOV> <SOV> and the Son of man indeed goes as it is determined , but woe unto that man by whom he is delivered up . <EOV> <SOV> And * they * began to question together among themselves who then it could be of them who was about to do this . <EOV> <SOV> And there was also a strife among them which of them should be held to be [ the ] greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , The kings of the nations rule over them , and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors . <EOV> <SOV> But * ye * [ shall ] not [ be ] thus ; but let the greater among you be as the younger , and the leader as he that serves . <EOV> <SOV> For which [ is ] greater , he that is at table or he that serves ? [ Is ] not he that is at table ? But * I * am in the midst of you as the one that serves . <EOV> <SOV> But * ye * are they who have persevered with me in my temptations . <EOV> <SOV> And * I * appoint unto you , as my Father has appointed unto me , a kingdom , <EOV> <SOV> that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan has demanded to have you , to sift [ you ] as wheat ; <EOV> <SOV> but * I * have besought for thee that thy faith fail not ; and * thou * , when once thou hast been restored , confirm thy brethren . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Lord , with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I tell thee , Peter , [ the ] cock shall not crow to - day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals , did ye lack anything ? And they said , Nothing . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore to them , But now he that has a purse let him take [ it ] , in like manner also a scrip , and he that has none let him sell his garment and buy a sword ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned with [ the ] lawless : for also the things concerning me have an end . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Lord , behold here are two swords . And he said to them , It is enough . <EOV> <SOV> And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives , and the disciples also followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was at the place he said to them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone 's throw , and having knelt down he prayed , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Father , if thou wilt remove this cup from me : -- but then , not my will , but thine be done . <EOV> <SOV> And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him . <EOV> <SOV> And being in conflict he prayed more intently . And his sweat became as great drops of blood , falling down upon the earth . <EOV> <SOV> And rising up from his prayer , coming to the disciples , he found them sleeping from grief . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why sleep ye ? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> As he was yet speaking , behold , a crowd , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went on before them , and drew near to Jesus to kiss him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Judas , deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss ? <EOV> <SOV> And they who were around him , seeing what was going to follow , said [ to him ] , Lord , shall we smite with [ the ] sword ? <EOV> <SOV> And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , Suffer thus far ; and having touched his ear , he healed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders , who were come against him , Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks ? <EOV> <SOV> When I was day by day with you in the temple ye did not stretch out your hands against me ; but this is your hour and the power of darkness . <EOV> <SOV> And having laid hold on him , they led him [ away ] , and they led [ him ] into the house of the high priest . And Peter followed afar off . <EOV> <SOV> And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together , Peter sat among them . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain maid , having seen him sitting by the light , and having fixed her eyes upon him , said , And this [ man ] was with him . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied [ him ] , saying , Woman , I do not know him . <EOV> <SOV> And after a short time another seeing him said , And * thou * art of them . But Peter said , Man , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it , saying , In truth this [ man ] also was with him , for also he is a Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he was yet speaking , [ the ] cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord , turning round , looked at Peter ; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he said to him , Before [ the ] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter , going forth without , wept bitterly . <EOV> <SOV> And the men who held him mocked him , beating [ him ] ; <EOV> <SOV> and covering him up , asked him saying , Prophesy , who is it that struck thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said many other injurious things to him . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , the elderhood of the people , both [ the ] chief priests and scribes , were gathered together , and led him into their council , saying , <EOV> <SOV> If * thou * art the Christ , tell us . And he said to them , If I tell you , ye will not at all believe ; <EOV> <SOV> and if I should ask [ you ] , ye would not answer me at all , nor let me go ; <EOV> <SOV> but henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the right hand of the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they all said , * Thou * then art the Son of God ? And he said to them , * Ye * say that I am . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , What need have we any more of witness , for we have heard ourselves out of his mouth ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the whole multitude of them , rising up , led him to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to accuse him , saying , We have found this [ man ] perverting our nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ , a king . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate demanded of him saying , Art * thou * the king of the Jews ? And he answering him said , Thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds , I find no guilt in this man . <EOV> <SOV> But they insisted , saying , He stirs up the people , teaching throughout all Judaea , beginning from Galilee even on to here . <EOV> <SOV> But Pilate , having heard Galilee [ named ] , demanded if the man were a Galilaean ; <EOV> <SOV> and having learned that he was of Herod 's jurisdiction , remitted him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days . <EOV> <SOV> And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced , for he had been a long while desirous of seeing him , because of hearing many things concerning him , and he hoped to see some sign done by him ; <EOV> <SOV> and he questioned him in many words , but * he * answered him nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and mocked him , having put a splendid robe upon him , sent him back to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the same day , for they had been at enmity before between themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate , having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people , <EOV> <SOV> said to them , Ye have brought to me this man as turning away the people [ to rebellion ] , and behold , I , having examined him before you , have found nothing criminal in this man as to the things of which ye accuse him ; <EOV> <SOV> nor Herod either , for I remitted you to him , and behold , nothing worthy of death is done by him . <EOV> <SOV> Having chastised him therefore , I will release him . <EOV> <SOV> ( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the feast . ) <EOV> <SOV> But they cried out in a mass saying , Away with this [ man ] and release Barabbas to us ; <EOV> <SOV> who was one who , for a certain tumult which had taken place in the city , and [ for ] murder , had been cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore , desirous to release Jesus , again addressed [ them ] . <EOV> <SOV> But they cried out in reply saying , Crucify , crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said the third time to them , What evil then has this [ man ] done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will chastise him therefore and release him . <EOV> <SOV> But they were urgent with loud voices , begging that he might be crucified . And their voices [ and those of the chief priests ] prevailed . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place . <EOV> <SOV> And he released him who , for tumult and murder , had been cast into prison , whom they begged for , and Jesus he delivered up to their will . <EOV> <SOV> And as they led him away , they laid hold on a certain Simon , a Cyrenian , coming from the field , and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And a great multitude of the people , and of women who wailed and lamented him , followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus turning round to them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep over me , but weep over yourselves and over your children ; <EOV> <SOV> for behold , days are coming in which they will say , Blessed [ are ] the barren , and wombs that have not borne , and breasts that have not given suck . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall upon us ; and to the hills , Cover us : <EOV> <SOV> for if these things are done in the green tree , what shall take place in the dry ? <EOV> <SOV> Now two others also , malefactors , were led with him to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came to the place which is called Skull , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , the other on the left . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . And , parting out his garments , they cast lots . <EOV> <SOV> And the people stood beholding , and the rulers also [ with them ] sneered , saying , He has saved others ; let him save himself if this is the Christ , the chosen one of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers also made game of him , coming up offering him vinegar , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , If * thou * be the king of the Jews , save thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And there was also an inscription [ written ] over him in Greek , and Roman , and Hebrew letters : This is the King of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him , saying , Art not thou the Christ ? save thyself and us . <EOV> <SOV> But the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost * thou * too not fear God , thou that art under the same judgment ? <EOV> <SOV> and * we * indeed justly , for we receive the just recompense of what we have done ; but this [ man ] has done nothing amiss . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to Jesus , Remember me , [ Lord , ] when thou comest in thy kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Verily I say to thee , To - day shalt thou be with me in paradise . <EOV> <SOV> And it was about [ the ] sixth hour , and there came darkness over the whole land until [ the ] ninth hour . <EOV> <SOV> And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple rent in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having cried with a loud voice , said , Father , into thy hands I commit my spirit . And having said this , he expired . <EOV> <SOV> Now the centurion , seeing what took place , glorified God , saying , In very deed this man was just . <EOV> <SOV> And all the crowds who had come together to that sight , having seen the things that took place , returned , beating [ their ] breasts . <EOV> <SOV> And all those who knew him stood afar off , the women also who had followed him from Galilee , beholding these things . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a man named Joseph , who was a councillor , a good man and a just <EOV> <SOV> ( this [ man ] had not assented to their counsel and deed ) , of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews , who also waited , [ himself also , ] for the kingdom of God <EOV> <SOV> -- he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus ; <EOV> <SOV> and having taken it down , wrapped it in fine linen and placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock , where no one had ever been laid . <EOV> <SOV> And it was preparation day , and [ the ] sabbath twilight was coming on . <EOV> <SOV> And women , who had come along with him out of Galilee , having followed , saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed . <EOV> <SOV> And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments , and remained quiet on the sabbath , according to the commandment . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But on the morrow of the sabbath , very early indeed in the morning , they came to the tomb , bringing the aromatic spices which they had prepared . <EOV> <SOV> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had entered they found not the body of the Lord Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as they were in perplexity about it , that behold , two men suddenly stood by them in shining raiment . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground , they said to them , Why seek ye the living one among the dead ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spoke to you , being yet in Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> saying , The Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinners , and be crucified , and rise the third day . <EOV> <SOV> And they remembered his words ; <EOV> <SOV> and , returning from the sepulchre , related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest . <EOV> <SOV> Now it was Mary of Magdala , and Johanna , and Mary the [ mother ] of James , and the others with them , who told these things to the apostles . <EOV> <SOV> And their words appeared in their eyes as an idle tale , and they disbelieved them . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter , rising up , ran to the sepulchre , and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone , and went away home , wondering at what had happened . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , two of them were going on the same day to a village distant sixty stadia from Jerusalem , called Emmaus ; <EOV> <SOV> and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned , that Jesus himself drawing nigh , went with them ; <EOV> <SOV> but their eyes were holden so as not to know him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk , and are downcast ? <EOV> <SOV> And one [ of them ] , named Cleopas , answering said to him , Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem , and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What things ? And they said to him , The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ; <EOV> <SOV> and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [ the ] judgment of death and crucified him . <EOV> <SOV> But * we * had hoped that * he * was [ the one ] who is about to redeem Israel . But then , besides all these things , it is now , to - day , the third day since these things took place . <EOV> <SOV> And withal , certain women from amongst us astonished us , having been very early at the sepulchre , <EOV> <SOV> and , not having found his body , came , saying that they also had seen a vision of angels , who say that he is living . <EOV> <SOV> And some of those with us went to the sepulchre , and found it so , as the women also had said , but him they saw not . <EOV> <SOV> And * he * said to them , O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken ! <EOV> <SOV> Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory ? <EOV> <SOV> And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets , he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself . <EOV> <SOV> And they drew near to the village where they were going , and * he * made as though he would go farther . <EOV> <SOV> And they constrained him , saying , Stay with us , for it is toward evening and the day is declining . And he entered in to stay with them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he was at table with them , having taken the bread , he blessed , and having broken it , gave it to them . <EOV> <SOV> And their eyes were opened , and they recognised him . And he disappeared from them . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to one another , Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way , [ and ] as he opened the scriptures to us ? <EOV> <SOV> And rising up the same hour , they returned to Jerusalem . And they found the eleven , and those with them , gathered together , <EOV> <SOV> saying , The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon . <EOV> <SOV> And they related what [ had happened ] on the way , and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were saying these things , he himself stood in their midst , and says to them , Peace [ be ] unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But they , being confounded and being frightened , supposed they beheld a spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why are ye troubled ? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> behold my hands and my feet , that it is * I * myself . Handle me and see , for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having . <EOV> <SOV> And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet . <EOV> <SOV> But while they yet did not believe for joy , and were wondering , he said to them , Have ye anything here to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb ; <EOV> <SOV> and he took it and ate before them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , These [ are ] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you , that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures , <EOV> <SOV> and said to them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer , and to rise from among the dead the third day ; <EOV> <SOV> and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And * ye * are witnesses of these things . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you ; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high . <EOV> <SOV> And he led them out as far as Bethany , and having lifted up his hands , he blessed them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he was blessing them , he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And * they * , having done him homage , returned to Jerusalem with great joy , <EOV> <SOV> and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God . <EOV> <EOC>
