<SOC> <SOV> In [ the ] beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . <EOV> <SOV> * He * was in the beginning with God . <EOV> <SOV> All things received being through him , and without him not one [ thing ] received being which has received being . <EOV> <SOV> In him was life , and the life was the light of men . <EOV> <SOV> And the light appears in darkness , and the darkness apprehended it not . <EOV> <SOV> There was a man sent from God , his name John . <EOV> <SOV> He came for witness , that he might witness concerning the light , that all might believe through him . <EOV> <SOV> * He * was not the light , but that he might witness concerning the light . <EOV> <SOV> The true light was that which , coming into the world , lightens every man . <EOV> <SOV> He was in the world , and the world had [ its ] being through him , and the world knew him not . <EOV> <SOV> He came to his own , and his own received him not ; <EOV> <SOV> but as many as received him , to them gave he [ the ] right to be children of God , to those that believe on his name ; <EOV> <SOV> who have been born , not of blood , nor of flesh 's will , nor of man 's will , but of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the Word became flesh , and dwelt among us ( and we have contemplated his glory , a glory as of an only - begotten with a father ) , full of grace and truth ; <EOV> <SOV> ( John bears witness of him , and he has cried , saying , This was he of whom I said , He that comes after me is preferred before me , for he was before me ; ) <EOV> <SOV> for of his fulness we all have received , and grace upon grace . <EOV> <SOV> For the law was given by Moses : grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ . <EOV> <SOV> No one has seen God at any time ; the only - begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , * he * hath declared [ him ] . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the witness of John , when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him , Thou , who art thou ? <EOV> <SOV> And he acknowledged and denied not , and acknowledged , I am not the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he says , I am not . Art thou the prophet ? And he answered , No . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to those who sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> He said , I [ am ] [ the ] voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the path of [ the ] Lord , as said Esaias the prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they were sent from among the Pharisees . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him and said to him , Why baptisest thou then , if thou art not the Christ , nor Elias , nor the prophet ? <EOV> <SOV> John answered them saying , I baptise with water . In the midst of you stands , whom ye do not know , <EOV> <SOV> he who comes after me , the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose . <EOV> <SOV> These things took place in Bethany , across the Jordan , where John was baptising . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him , and says , Behold the Lamb of God , who takes away the sin of the world . <EOV> <SOV> He it is of whom I said , A man comes after me who takes a place before me , because he * was * before me ; <EOV> <SOV> and I knew him not ; but that he might be manifested to Israel , therefore have I come baptising with water . <EOV> <SOV> And John bore witness , saying , I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven , and it abode upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew him not ; but he who sent me to baptise with water , * he * said to me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him , he it is who baptises with [ the ] Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Again , on the morrow , there stood John and two of his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And , looking at Jesus as he walked , he says , Behold the Lamb of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the two disciples heard him speaking , and followed Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus having turned , and seeing them following , says to them , What seek ye ? And * they * said to him , Rabbi ( which , being interpreted , signifies Teacher ) , where abidest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> He says to them , Come and see . They went therefore , and saw where he abode ; and they abode with him that day . It was about the tenth hour . <EOV> <SOV> Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who heard [ this ] from John and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> He first finds his own brother Simon , and says to him , We have found the Messias ( which being interpreted is Christ ) . <EOV> <SOV> And he led him to Jesus . Jesus looking at him said , Thou art Simon , the son of Jonas ; thou shalt be called Cephas ( which interpreted is stone ) . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee , and Jesus finds Philip , and says to him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter . <EOV> <SOV> Philip finds Nathanael , and says to him , We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law , and the prophets , Jesus , the son of Joseph , who is from Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> And Nathanael said to him , Can anything good come out of Nazareth ? Philip says to him , Come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and says of him , Behold [ one ] truly an Israelite , in whom there is no guile . <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael says to him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said to him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig - tree , I saw thee . <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael answered and said to him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God , thou art the King of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , Because I said to thee , I saw thee under the fig - tree , believest thou ? Thou shalt see greater things than these . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to him , Verily , verily , I say to you , Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus also , and his disciples , were invited to the marriage . <EOV> <SOV> And wine being deficient , the mother of Jesus says to him , They have no wine . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , What have I to do with thee , woman ? mine hour has not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> His mother says to the servants , Whatever he may say to you , do . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were standing there six stone water - vessels , according to the purification of the Jews , holding two or three measures each . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to them , Fill the water - vessels with water . And they filled them up to the brim . <EOV> <SOV> And he says to them , Draw out now , and carry [ it ] to the feast - master . And they carried [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> But when the feast - master had tasted the water which had been made wine ( and knew not whence it was , but the servants knew who drew the water ) , the feast - master calls the bridegroom , <EOV> <SOV> and says to him , Every man sets on first the good wine , and when [ men ] have well drunk , then the inferior ; thou hast kept the good wine till now . <EOV> <SOV> This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> After this he descended to Capernaum , he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples ; and there they abode not many days . <EOV> <SOV> And the passover of the Jews was near , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves , and the money - changers sitting ; <EOV> <SOV> and , having made a scourge of cords , he cast [ them ] all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the change of the money - changers , and overturned the tables , <EOV> <SOV> and said to the sellers of doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house a house of merchandise . <EOV> <SOV> [ And ] his disciples remembered that it is written , The zeal of thy house devours me . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore answered and said to him , What sign shewest thou to us , that thou doest these things ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said , Forty and six years was this temple building , and thou wilt raise it up in three days ? <EOV> <SOV> But * he * spoke of the temple of his body . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he was raised from among [ the ] dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this , and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was in Jerusalem , at the passover , at the feast , many believed on his name , beholding his signs which he wrought . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them , because he knew all [ men ] , <EOV> <SOV> and that he had not need that any should testify of man , for himself knew what was in man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But there was a man from among the Pharisees , his name Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews ; <EOV> <SOV> he came to him by night , and said to him , Rabbi , we know that thou art come a teacher from God , for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except any one be born anew he can not see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus says to him , How can a man be born being old ? can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except any one be born of water and of Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Do not wonder that I said to thee , It is needful that * ye * should be born anew . <EOV> <SOV> The wind blows where it will , and thou hearest its voice , but knowest not whence it comes and where it goes : thus is every one that is born of the Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus answered and said to him , How can these things be ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things ! <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that which we know , and we bear witness of that which we have seen , and ye receive not our witness . <EOV> <SOV> If I have said the earthly things to you , and ye believe not , how , if I say the heavenly things to you , will ye believe ? <EOV> <SOV> And no one has gone up into heaven , save he who came down out of heaven , the Son of man who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , thus must the Son of man be lifted up , <EOV> <SOV> that every one who believes on him may [ not perish , but ] have life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> For God so loved the world , that he gave his only - begotten Son , that whosoever believes on him may not perish , but have life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> For God has not sent his Son into the world that he may judge the world , but that the world may be saved through him . <EOV> <SOV> He that believes on him is not judged : but he that believes not has been already judged , because he has not believed on the name of the only - begotten Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the judgment , that light is come into the world , and men have loved darkness rather than light ; for their works were evil . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that does evil hates the light , and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are ; <EOV> <SOV> but he that practises the truth comes to the light , that his works may be manifested that they have been wrought in God . <EOV> <SOV> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he abode with them and baptised . <EOV> <SOV> And John also was baptising in Aenon , near Salim , because there was a great deal of water there ; and they came to [ him ] and were baptised : <EOV> <SOV> for John was not yet cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to John and said to him , Rabbi , he who was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , he baptises , and all come to him . <EOV> <SOV> John answered and said , A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said , I am not the Christ , but , that I am sent before him . <EOV> <SOV> He that has the bride is the bridegroom ; but the friend of the bridegroom , who stands and hears him , rejoices in heart because of the voice of the bridegroom : this my joy then is fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> He must increase , but I must decrease . <EOV> <SOV> He who comes from above is above all . He who has his origin in the earth is of the earth , and speaks [ as ] of the earth . He who comes out of heaven is above all , <EOV> <SOV> [ and ] what he has seen and has heard , this he testifies ; and no one receives his testimony . <EOV> <SOV> He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true ; <EOV> <SOV> for he whom God has sent speaks the words of God , for God gives not the Spirit by measure . <EOV> <SOV> The Father loves the Son , and has given all things [ to be ] in his hand . <EOV> <SOV> He that believes on the Son has life eternal , and he that is not subject to the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God abides upon him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John <EOV> <SOV> ( however , Jesus himself did not baptise , but his disciples ) , <EOV> <SOV> he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And he must needs pass through Samaria . <EOV> <SOV> He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar , near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> Now a fountain of Jacob 's was there ; Jesus therefore , being wearied with the way he had come , sat just as he was at the fountain . It was about the sixth hour . <EOV> <SOV> A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water . Jesus says to her , Give me to drink <EOV> <SOV> ( for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions ) . <EOV> <SOV> The Samaritan woman therefore says to him , How dost thou , being a Jew , ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman ? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that says to thee , Give me to drink , thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water . <EOV> <SOV> The woman says to him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : whence then hast thou the living water ? <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , and his sons , and his cattle ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to her , Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again ; <EOV> <SOV> but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever , but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water , springing up into eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> The woman says to him , Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst nor come here to draw . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , Go , call thy husband , and come here . <EOV> <SOV> The woman answered and said , I have not a husband . Jesus says to her , Thou hast well said , I have not a husband ; <EOV> <SOV> for thou hast had five husbands , and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband : this thou hast spoken truly . <EOV> <SOV> The woman says to him , Sir , I see that thou art a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain , and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , Woman , believe me , [ the ] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Ye worship ye know not what ; we worship what we know , for salvation is of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> But [ the ] hour is coming and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth ; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers . <EOV> <SOV> God [ is ] a spirit ; and they who worship him must worship [ him ] in spirit and truth . <EOV> <SOV> The woman says to him , I know that Messias is coming , who is called Christ ; when * he * comes he will tell us all things . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , I who speak to thee am [ he ] . <EOV> <SOV> And upon this came his disciples , and wondered that he spoke with a woman ; yet no one said , What seekest thou ? or , Why speakest thou with her ? <EOV> <SOV> The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city , and says to the men , <EOV> <SOV> Come , see a man who told me all things I had ever done : is not he the Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> They went out of the city and came to him . <EOV> <SOV> But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying , Rabbi , eat . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , I have food to eat which ye do not know . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples therefore said to one another , Has any one brought him [ anything ] to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to them , My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me , and that I should finish his work . <EOV> <SOV> Do not ye say , that there are yet four months and the harvest comes ? Behold , I say to you , Lift up your eyes and behold the fields , for they are already white to harvest . <EOV> <SOV> He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal , that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together . <EOV> <SOV> For in this is [ verified ] the true saying , It is one who sows and another who reaps . <EOV> <SOV> I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured ; others have laboured , and ye have entered into their labours . <EOV> <SOV> But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness , He told me all things that I had ever done . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them , and he abode there two days . <EOV> <SOV> And more a great deal believed on account of his word ; <EOV> <SOV> and they said to the woman , [ It is ] no longer on account of thy saying that we believe , for we have heard him ourselves , and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world . <EOV> <SOV> But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he came into Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast , for they also went to the feast . <EOV> <SOV> He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick . <EOV> <SOV> He , having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee , went to him and asked [ him ] that he would come down and heal his son , for he was about to die . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to him , Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> The courtier says to him , Sir , come down ere my child die . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , Go , thy son lives . And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him , and went his way . <EOV> <SOV> But already , as he was going down , his servants met him and brought [ him ] word saying , Thy child lives . <EOV> <SOV> He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better . And they said to him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . <EOV> <SOV> The father therefore knew that [ it was ] in that hour in which Jesus said to him , Thy son lives ; and he believed , himself and his whole house . <EOV> <SOV> This second sign again did Jesus , being come out of Judaea into Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Now there is in Jerusalem , at the sheepgate , a pool , which is called in Hebrew , Bethesda , having five porches . <EOV> <SOV> In these lay a multitude of sick , blind , lame , withered , [ awaiting the moving of the water . <EOV> <SOV> For an angel descended at a certain season in the pool and troubled the water . Whoever therefore first went in after the troubling of the water became well , whatever disease he laboured under . ] <EOV> <SOV> But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus seeing this [ man ] lying [ there ] , and knowing that he was [ in that state ] now a great length of time , says to him , Wouldest thou become well ? <EOV> <SOV> The infirm [ man ] answered him , Sir , I have not a man , in order , when the water has been troubled , to cast me into the pool ; but while I am coming another descends before me . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , Arise , take up thy couch and walk . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the man became well , and took up his couch and walked : and on that day was sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said to the healed [ man ] , It is sabbath , it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch . <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , He that made me well , * he * said to me , Take up thy couch and walk . <EOV> <SOV> They asked him [ therefore ] , Who is the man who said to thee , Take up thy couch and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But he that had been healed knew not who it was , for Jesus had slidden away , there being a crowd in the place . <EOV> <SOV> After these things Jesus finds him in the temple , and said to him , Behold , thou art become well : sin no more , that something worse do not happen to thee . <EOV> <SOV> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well . <EOV> <SOV> And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [ and sought to kill him ] , because he had done these things on sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto and I work . <EOV> <SOV> For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he had not only violated the sabbath , but also said that God was his own Father , making himself equal with God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answered and said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing : for whatever things * he * does , these things also the Son does in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does ; and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may wonder . <EOV> <SOV> For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [ them ] , thus the Son also quickens whom he will : <EOV> <SOV> for neither does the Father judge any one , but has given all judgment to the Son ; <EOV> <SOV> that all may honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He who honours not the Son , honours not the Father who has sent him . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , that he that hears my word , and believes him that has sent me , has life eternal , and does not come into judgment , but is passed out of death into life . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , that an hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God , and they that have heard shall live . <EOV> <SOV> For even as the Father has life in himself , so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself , <EOV> <SOV> and has given him authority to execute judgment [ also ] , because he is Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Wonder not at this , for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice , <EOV> <SOV> and shall go forth ; those that have practised good , to resurrection of life , and those that have done evil , to resurrection of judgment . <EOV> <SOV> I can not do anything of myself ; as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous , because I do not seek my will , but the will of him that has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I bear witness concerning myself , my witness is not true . <EOV> <SOV> It is another who bears witness concerning me , and I know that the witness which he bears concerning me is true . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have sent unto John , and he has borne witness to the truth . <EOV> <SOV> But I do not receive witness from man , but I say this that * ye * might be saved . <EOV> <SOV> * He * was the burning and shining lamp , and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light . <EOV> <SOV> But I have the witness [ that is ] greater than [ that ] of John ; for the works which the Father has given me that I should complete them , the works themselves which I do , bear witness concerning me that the Father has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor have seen his shape , <EOV> <SOV> and ye have not his word abiding in you ; for whom * he * hath sent , him ye do not believe . <EOV> <SOV> Ye search the scriptures , for ye think that in them ye have life eternal , and they it is which bear witness concerning me ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye will not come to me that ye might have life . <EOV> <SOV> I do not receive glory from men , <EOV> <SOV> but I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you . <EOV> <SOV> I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not ; if another come in his own name , him ye will receive . <EOV> <SOV> How can ye believe , who receive glory one of another , and seek not the glory which [ comes ] from God alone ? <EOV> <SOV> Think not that I will accuse you to the Father : there is [ one ] who accuses you , Moses , on whom ye trust ; <EOV> <SOV> for if ye had believed Moses , ye would have believed me , for he wrote of me . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye do not believe his writings , how shall ye believe my words ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee , [ or ] of Tiberias , <EOV> <SOV> and a great crowd followed him , because they saw the signs which he wrought upon the sick . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went up into the mountain , and there sat with his disciples : <EOV> <SOV> but the passover , the feast of the Jews , was near . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus then , lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to him , says to Philip , Whence shall we buy loaves that these may eat ? <EOV> <SOV> But this he said trying him , for he knew what he was going to do . <EOV> <SOV> Philip answered him , Loaves for two hundred denarii are not sufficient for them , that each may have some little [ portion ] . <EOV> <SOV> One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , says to him , <EOV> <SOV> There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes ; but this , what is it for so many ? <EOV> <SOV> [ And ] Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place : the men therefore sat down , in number about five thousand . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus took the loaves , and having given thanks , distributed [ them ] to those that were set down ; and in like manner of the small fishes as much as they would . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had been filled , he says to his disciples , Gather together the fragments which are over and above , that nothing may be lost . <EOV> <SOV> They gathered [ them ] therefore together , and filled twelve hand - baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves , which were over and above to those that had eaten . <EOV> <SOV> The men therefore , having seen the sign which Jesus had done , said , This is truly the prophet which is coming into the world . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and seize him , that they might make [ him ] king , departed again to the mountain himself alone . <EOV> <SOV> But when evening was come , his disciples went down to the sea , <EOV> <SOV> and having gone on board ship , they went over the sea to Capernaum . And it had already become dark , and Jesus had not come to them , <EOV> <SOV> and the sea was agitated by a strong wind blowing . <EOV> <SOV> Having rowed then about twenty - five or thirty stadia , they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship ; and they were frightened . <EOV> <SOV> But he says to them , It is I : be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship ; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea , having seen that there was no other little ship there except that into which his disciples had got , and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the ship , but [ that ] his disciples had gone away alone ; <EOV> <SOV> ( but other little ships out of Tiberias came near to the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks ; ) <EOV> <SOV> when therefore the crowd saw that Jesus was not there , nor his disciples , * they * got into the ships , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And having found him the other side of the sea , they said to him , Rabbi , when art thou arrived here ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , Ye seek me not because ye have seen signs , but because ye have eaten of the loaves and been filled . <EOV> <SOV> Work not [ for ] the food which perishes , but [ for ] the food which abides unto life eternal , which the Son of man shall give to you ; for him has the Father sealed , [ even ] God . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , What should we do that we may work the works of God ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom * he * has sent . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , What sign then doest thou that we may see and believe thee ? what dost thou work ? <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , as it is written , He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , [ It is ] not Moses that has given you the bread out of heaven ; but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For the bread of God is he who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , Lord , ever give to us this bread . <EOV> <SOV> [ And ] Jesus said to them , I am the bread of life : he that comes to me shall never hunger , and he that believes on me shall never thirst at any time . <EOV> <SOV> But I have said to you , that ye have also seen me and do not believe . <EOV> <SOV> All that the Father gives me shall come to me , and him that comes to me I will not at all cast out . <EOV> <SOV> For I am come down from heaven , not that I should do * my * will , but the will of him that has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the will of him that has sent me , that of all that he has given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For this is the will of my Father , that every one who sees the Son , and believes on him , should have life eternal ; and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore murmured about him , because he said , I am the bread which has come down out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we have known ? how then does * he * say , I am come down out of heaven ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answered and said to them , Murmur not among yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> No one can come to me except the Father who has sent me draw him , and I will raise him up in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every one that has heard from the Father [ himself ] , and has learned [ of him ] , comes to me ; <EOV> <SOV> not that any one has seen the Father , except he who is of God , he has seen the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He that believes [ on me ] has life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> I am the bread of life . <EOV> <SOV> Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and died . <EOV> <SOV> This is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that one may eat of it and not die . <EOV> <SOV> I am the living bread which has come down out of heaven : if any one shall have eaten of this bread he shall live for ever ; but the bread withal which I shall give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore contended among themselves , saying , How can he give us this flesh to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man , and drunk his blood , ye have no life in yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has life eternal , and I will raise him up at the last day : <EOV> <SOV> for my flesh is truly food and my blood is truly drink . <EOV> <SOV> He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood dwells in me and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> As the living Father has sent me and I live on account of the Father , * he * also who eats me shall live also on account of me . <EOV> <SOV> This is the bread which has come down out of heaven . Not as the fathers ate and died : he that eats this bread shall live for ever . <EOV> <SOV> These things he said in [ the ] synagogue , teaching in Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> Many therefore of his disciples having heard [ it ] said , This word is hard ; who can hear it ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , knowing in himself that his disciples murmur concerning this , said to them , Does this offend you ? <EOV> <SOV> If then ye see the Son of man ascending up where he was before ? <EOV> <SOV> It is the Spirit which quickens , the flesh profits nothing : the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life . <EOV> <SOV> But there are some of you who do not believe . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe , and who would deliver him up . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father . <EOV> <SOV> From that [ time ] many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to the twelve , Will ye also go away ? <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast words of life eternal ; <EOV> <SOV> and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you the twelve ? and of you one is a devil . <EOV> <SOV> Now he spoke of Judas [ the son ] of Simon , Iscariote , for he [ it was who ] should deliver him up , being one of the twelve . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee , for he would not walk in Judaea , because the Jews sought to kill him . <EOV> <SOV> Now the tabernacles , the feast of the Jews , was near . <EOV> <SOV> His brethren therefore said to him , Remove hence and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest ; <EOV> <SOV> for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be [ known ] in public . If thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world : <EOV> <SOV> for neither did his brethren believe on him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore says to them , My time is not yet come , but your time is always ready . <EOV> <SOV> The world can not hate you , but me it hates , because I bear witness concerning it that its works are evil . <EOV> <SOV> Ye , go ye up to this feast . I go not up to this feast , for * my * time is not yet fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> Having said these things to them he abode in Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But when his brethren had gone up , then he himself also went up to the feast , not openly , but as in secret . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ? <EOV> <SOV> And there was much murmuring concerning him among the crowds . Some said , He is [ a ] good [ man ] ; others said , No ; but he deceives the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> However , no one spoke openly concerning him on account of [ their ] fear of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> But when it was now the middle of the feast , Jesus went up into the temple and taught . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore wondered , saying , How knows this [ man ] letters , having never learned ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answered them and said , My doctrine is not mine , but [ that ] of him that has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If any one desire to practise his will , he shall know concerning the doctrine , whether it is of God , or [ that ] I speak from myself . <EOV> <SOV> He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory ; but he that seeks the glory of him that has sent him , he is true , and unrighteousness is not in him . <EOV> <SOV> Has not Moses given you the law , and no one of you practises the law ? Why do ye seek to kill me ? <EOV> <SOV> The crowd answered [ and said ] , Thou hast a demon : who seeks to kill thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , I have done one work , and ye all wonder . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore Moses gave you circumcision ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) , and ye circumcise a man on sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> If a man receives circumcision on sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be violated , are ye angry with me because I have made a man entirely sound on sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> Judge not according to sight , but judge righteous judgment . <EOV> <SOV> Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ? <EOV> <SOV> and behold , he speaks openly , and they say nothing to him . Have the rulers then indeed recognised that this is the Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> But [ as to ] this [ man ] we know whence he is . Now [ as to ] the Christ , when he comes , no one knows whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching and saying , Ye both know me and ye know whence I am ; and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye do not know . <EOV> <SOV> I know him , because I am from him , and * he * has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> They sought therefore to take him ; and no one laid his hand upon him , because his hour had not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> But many of the crowd believed on him , and said , Will the Christ , when he comes , do more signs than those which this [ man ] has done ? <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they might take him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said , Yet a little while I am with you , and I go to him that has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Ye shall seek me and shall not find [ me ] , and where I am ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said to one another , Where is he about to go that we shall not find him ? Is he about to go to the dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ? <EOV> <SOV> What word is this which he said , Ye shall seek me and shall not find [ me ] ; and where I am ye can not come ? <EOV> <SOV> In the last , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried saying , If any one thirst , let him come to me and drink . <EOV> <SOV> He that believes on me , as the scripture has said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water . <EOV> <SOV> But this he said concerning the Spirit , which they that believed on him were about to receive ; for [ the ] Spirit was not yet , because Jesus had not yet been glorified . <EOV> <SOV> [ Some ] out of the crowd therefore , having heard this word , said , This is truly the prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Others said , This is the Christ . Others said , Does then the Christ come out of Galilee ? <EOV> <SOV> Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David , and from the village of Bethlehem , where David was ? <EOV> <SOV> There was a division therefore in the crowd on account of him . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them desired to take him , but no one laid hands upon him . <EOV> <SOV> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , Why have ye not brought him ? <EOV> <SOV> The officers answered , Never man spoke thus , as this man [ speaks ] . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore answered them , Are ye also deceived ? <EOV> <SOV> Has any one of the rulers believed on him , or of the Pharisees ? <EOV> <SOV> But this crowd , which does not know the law , are accursed . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus says to them ( being one of themselves ) , <EOV> <SOV> Does our law judge a man before it have first heard from himself , and know what he does ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search and look , that no prophet arises out of Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And every one went to his home . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> But Jesus went to the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him ; and he sat down and taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring [ to him ] a woman taken in adultery , and having set her in the midst , <EOV> <SOV> they say to him , Teacher , this woman has been taken in the very act , committing adultery . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such ; thou therefore , what sayest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> But this they said proving him , that they might have [ something ] to accuse him [ of ] . But Jesus , having stooped down , wrote with his finger on the ground . <EOV> <SOV> But when they continued asking him , he lifted himself up and said to them , Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her . <EOV> <SOV> And again stooping down he wrote on the ground . <EOV> <SOV> But they , having heard [ that ] , went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last ; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman , said to her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? Has no one condemned thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And she said , No one , sir . And Jesus said to her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more . <EOV> <SOV> Again therefore Jesus spoke to them , saying , I am the light of the world ; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said to him , Thou bearest witness concerning thyself ; thy witness is not true . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , Even if I bear witness concerning myself , my witness is true , because I know whence I came and whither I go : but ye know not whence I come and whither I go . <EOV> <SOV> Ye judge according to the flesh , I judge no one . <EOV> <SOV> And if also I judge , my judgment is true , because I am not alone , but I and the Father who has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true : <EOV> <SOV> I am [ one ] who bear witness concerning myself , and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> They said to him therefore , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye know neither me nor my Father . If ye had known me , ye would have known also my Father . <EOV> <SOV> These words spoke he in the treasury , teaching in the temple ; and no one took him , for his hour was not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore again to them , I go away , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sin ; where I go ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said , Will he kill himself , that he says , Where I go ye can not come ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above . Ye are of this world ; I am not of this world . <EOV> <SOV> I said therefore to you , that ye shall die in your sins ; for unless ye shall believe that I am [ he ] , ye shall die in your sins . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , Who art thou ? [ And ] Jesus said to them , Altogether that which I also say to you . <EOV> <SOV> I have many things to say and to judge concerning you , but he that has sent me is true , and I , what I have heard from him , these things I say to the world . <EOV> <SOV> They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to them , When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man , then ye shall know that I am [ he ] , and [ that ] I do nothing of myself , but as the Father has taught me I speak these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he that has sent me is with me ; he has not left me alone , because I do always the things that are pleasing to him . <EOV> <SOV> As he spoke these things many believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him , If ye abide in my word , ye are truly my disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall set you free . <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , We are Abraham 's seed , and have never been under bondage to any one ; how sayest thou , Ye shall become free ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say to you , Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin . <EOV> <SOV> Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever : the son abides for ever . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore the Son shall set you free , ye shall be really free . <EOV> <SOV> I know that ye are Abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word has no entrance in you . <EOV> <SOV> I speak what I have seen with my Father , and ye then do what ye have seen with your father . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , Abraham is our father . Jesus says to them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham ; <EOV> <SOV> but now ye seek to kill me , a man who has spoken the truth to you , which I have heard from God : this did not Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Ye do the works of your father . They said [ therefore ] to him , We are not born of fornication ; we have one father , God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , If God were your father ye would have loved me , for I came forth from God and am come [ from him ] ; for neither am I come of myself , but * he * has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Why do ye not know my speech ? Because ye can not hear my word . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are of the devil , as [ your ] father , and ye desire to do the lusts of your father . He was a murderer from the beginning , and has not stood in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaks falsehood , he speaks of what is his own ; for he is a liar and its father : <EOV> <SOV> and because I speak the truth , ye do not believe me . <EOV> <SOV> Which of you convinces me of sin ? If I speak truth , why do ye not believe me ? <EOV> <SOV> He that is of God hears the words of God : therefore ye hear [ them ] not , because ye are not of God . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered and said to him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I have not a demon ; but I honour my Father , and ye dishonour me . <EOV> <SOV> But I do not seek my own glory : there is he that seeks and judges . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , If any one shall keep my word , he shall never see death . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said to him , Now we know that thou hast a demon . Abraham has died , and the prophets , and thou sayest , If any one keep my word , he shall never taste death . <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who has died ? and the prophets have died : whom makest thou thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing : it is my Father who glorifies me , [ of ] whom ye say , He is our God . <EOV> <SOV> And ye know him not ; but I know him ; and if I said , I know him not , I should be like you , a liar . But I know him , and I keep his word . <EOV> <SOV> Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day , and he saw and rejoiced . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said to him , Thou hast not yet fifty years , and hast thou seen Abraham ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am . <EOV> <SOV> They took up therefore stones that they might cast [ them ] at him ; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple , [ going through the midst of them , and thus passed on . ] <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as he passed on , he saw a man blind from birth . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , Rabbi , who sinned , this [ man ] or his parents , that he should be born blind ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Neither has this [ man ] sinned nor his parents , but that the works of God should be manifested in him . <EOV> <SOV> I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day . [ The ] night is coming , when no one can work . <EOV> <SOV> As long as I am in the world , I am [ the ] light of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Having said these things , he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle , and put the mud , as ointment , on his eyes . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , which is interpreted , Sent . He went therefore and washed , and came seeing . <EOV> <SOV> The neighbours therefore , and those who used to see him before , that he was a beggar , said , Is not this he that was sitting and begging ? <EOV> <SOV> Some said , It is he ; others said , No , but he is like him : * he * said , It is I. <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , How have thine eyes been opened ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered [ and said ] , A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes , and said to me , Go to Siloam and wash : and having gone and washed , I saw . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , Where is he ? He says , I do not know . <EOV> <SOV> They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees . <EOV> <SOV> Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight . And he said to them , He put mud upon mine eyes , and I washed , and I see . <EOV> <SOV> Some of the Pharisees therefore said , This man is not of God , for he does not keep the sabbath . Others said , How can a sinful man perform such signs ? And there was a division among them . <EOV> <SOV> They say therefore again to the blind [ man ] , What dost thou say of him , that he has opened thine eyes ? And he said , He is a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight , until they had called the parents of him that had received sight . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked them saying , This is your son , of whom ye say that he was born blind : how then does he now see ? <EOV> <SOV> His parents answered [ them ] and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind ; <EOV> <SOV> but how he now sees we do not know , or who has opened his eyes we do not know . * He * is of age : ask * him * ; * he * will speak concerning himself . <EOV> <SOV> His parents said these things because they feared the Jews , for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [ to be the ] Christ , he should be excommunicated from the synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> On this account his parents said , He is of age : ask * him*. <EOV> <SOV> They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind , and said to him , Give glory to God : we know that this man is sinful . <EOV> <SOV> He answered therefore , If he is sinful I know not . One thing I know , that , being blind [ before ] , now I see . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him again , What did he do to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , I told you already and ye did not hear : why do ye desire to hear again ? do ye also wish to become his disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> They railed at him , and said , Thou art his disciple , but we are disciples of Moses . <EOV> <SOV> We know that God spoke to Moses ; but [ as to ] this [ man ] , we know not whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> The man answered and said to them , Now in this is a wonderful thing , that * ye * do not know whence he is , and he has opened mine eyes . <EOV> <SOV> [ But ] we know that God does not hear sinners ; but if any one be God - fearing and do his will , him he hears . <EOV> <SOV> Since time was , it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind . <EOV> <SOV> If this [ man ] were not of God he would be able to do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , Thou hast been wholly born in sins , and thou teachest us ? And they cast him out . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus heard that they had cast him out , and having found him , he said to him , Thou , dost thou believe on the Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , And who is he , Lord , that I may believe on him ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Thou hast both seen him , and he that speaks with thee is he . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I believe , Lord : and he did him homage . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , For judgment am I come into this world , that they which see not may see , and they which see may become blind . <EOV> <SOV> And [ some ] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and they said to him , Are we blind also ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , If ye were blind ye would not have sin ; but now ye say , We see , your sin remains . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep , but mounts up elsewhere , * he * is a thief and a robber ; <EOV> <SOV> but he that enters in by the door is [ the ] shepherd of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> To him the porter opens ; and the sheep hear his voice ; and he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out . <EOV> <SOV> When he has put forth all his own , he goes before them , and the sheep follow him , because they know his voice . <EOV> <SOV> But they will not follow a stranger , but will flee from him , because they know not the voice of strangers . <EOV> <SOV> This allegory spoke Jesus to them , but they did not know what it was [ of ] which he spoke to them . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said again to them , Verily , verily , I say to you , I am the door of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers ; but the sheep did not hear them . <EOV> <SOV> I am the door : if any one enter in by me , he shall be saved , and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture . <EOV> <SOV> The thief comes not but that he may steal , and kill , and destroy : I am come that they might have life , and might have [ it ] abundantly . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd . The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep : <EOV> <SOV> but he who serves for wages , and who is not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , sees the wolf coming , and leaves the sheep and flees ; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages , and is not himself concerned about the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd ; and I know those that are mine , and am known of those that are mine , <EOV> <SOV> as the Father knows me and I know the Father ; and I lay down my life for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> And I have other sheep which are not of this fold : those also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one flock , one shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> On this account the Father loves me , because I lay down my life that I may take it again . <EOV> <SOV> No one takes it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again . I have received this commandment of my Father . <EOV> <SOV> There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words ; <EOV> <SOV> but many of them said , He has a demon and raves ; why do ye hear him ? <EOV> <SOV> Others said , These sayings are not [ those ] of one that is possessed by a demon . Can a demon open blind people 's eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem , and it was winter . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore surrounded him , and said to him , Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense ? If thou art the Christ , say [ so ] to us openly . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye do not believe . The works which I do in my Father 's name , these bear witness concerning me : <EOV> <SOV> but ye do not believe , for ye are not of my sheep , as I told you . <EOV> <SOV> My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me ; <EOV> <SOV> and I give them life eternal ; and they shall never perish , and no one shall seize them out of my hand . <EOV> <SOV> My Father who has given [ them ] to me is greater than all , and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father . <EOV> <SOV> I and the Father are one . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewn you of my Father ; for which work of them do ye stone me ? <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , For a good work we stone thee not , but for blasphemy , and because thou , being a man , makest thyself God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ? <EOV> <SOV> If he called * them * gods to whom the word of God came ( and the scripture can not be broken ) , <EOV> <SOV> do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest , because I said , I am Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not ; <EOV> <SOV> but if I do , even if ye believe not me , believe the works , that ye may know [ and believe ] that the Father is in me and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> They sought therefore again to take him ; and he went away from out of their hand <EOV> <SOV> and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first : and he abode there . <EOV> <SOV> And many came to him , and said , John did no sign ; but all things which John said of this [ man ] were true . <EOV> <SOV> And many believed on him there . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now there was a certain [ man ] sick , Lazarus of Bethany , of the village of Mary and Martha her sister . <EOV> <SOV> It was [ the ] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . <EOV> <SOV> The sisters therefore sent to him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus heard [ it ] , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified by it . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he heard , He is sick , he remained two days then in the place where he was . <EOV> <SOV> Then after this he says to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples say to him , Rabbi , [ even but ] now the Jews sought to stone thee , and goest thou thither again ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any one walk in the day , he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world ; <EOV> <SOV> but if any one walk in the night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him . <EOV> <SOV> These things said he ; and after this he says to them , Lazarus , our friend , is fallen asleep , but I go that I may awake him out of sleep . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples therefore said to him , Lord , if he be fallen asleep , he will get well . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus spoke of his death , but * they * thought that he spoke of the rest of sleep . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore then said to them plainly , Lazarus has died . <EOV> <SOV> And I rejoice on your account that I was not there , in order that ye may believe . But let us go to him . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas therefore , called Didymus , said to his fellow disciples , Let * us * also go , that we may die with him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore [ on ] arriving found him to have been four days already in the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , about fifteen stadia off , <EOV> <SOV> and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , that they might console them concerning their brother . <EOV> <SOV> Martha then , when she heard Jesus is coming , went to meet him ; but Mary sat in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Martha therefore said to Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died ; <EOV> <SOV> but even now I know , that whatsoever thou shalt ask of God , God will give thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , Thy brother shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Martha says to him , I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to her , I am the resurrection and the life : he that believes on me , though he have died , shall live ; <EOV> <SOV> and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die . Believest thou this ? <EOV> <SOV> She says to him , Yea , Lord ; I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , who should come into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And having said this , she went away and called her sister Mary secretly , saying , The teacher is come and calls thee . <EOV> <SOV> She , when she heard [ that ] , rises up quickly and comes to him . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was in the place where Martha came to meet him . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and consoling her , seeing Mary that she rose up quickly and went out , followed her , saying , She goes to the tomb , that she may weep there . <EOV> <SOV> Mary therefore , when she came where Jesus was , seeing him , fell at his feet , saying to him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore , when he saw her weeping , and the Jews who came with her weeping , was deeply moved in spirit , and was troubled , <EOV> <SOV> and said , Where have ye put him ? They say to him , Lord , come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus wept . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said , Behold how he loved him ! <EOV> <SOV> And some of them said , Could not this [ man ] , who has opened the eyes of the blind [ man ] , have caused that this [ man ] also should not have died ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore , again deeply moved in himself , comes to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says , Take away the stone . Martha , the sister of the dead , says to him , Lord , he stinks already , for he is four days [ there ] . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , Did I not say to thee , that if thou shouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ? <EOV> <SOV> They took therefore the stone away . And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me ; <EOV> <SOV> but I knew that thou always hearest me ; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said [ it ] , that they may believe that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And having said this , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth . <EOV> <SOV> And the dead came forth , bound feet and hands with graveclothes , and his face was bound round with a handkerchief . Jesus says to them , Loose him and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done , believed on him ; <EOV> <SOV> but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done . <EOV> <SOV> The chief priests , therefore , and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , What do we ? for this man does many signs . <EOV> <SOV> If we let him thus alone , all will believe on him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said to them , Ye know nothing <EOV> <SOV> nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people , and not that the whole nation perish . <EOV> <SOV> But this he did not say of himself ; but , being high priest that year , prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation ; <EOV> <SOV> and not for the nation only , but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> From that day therefore they took counsel that they might kill him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews , but went away thence into the country near the desert , to a city called Ephraim , and there he sojourned with the disciples . <EOV> <SOV> But the passover of the Jews was near , and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover , that they might purify themselves . <EOV> <SOV> They sought therefore Jesus , and said among themselves , standing in the temple , What do ye think ? that he will not come to the feast ? <EOV> <SOV> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment that if any one knew where he was , he should make it known , that they might take him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Jesus therefore , six days before the passover , came to Bethany , where was the dead [ man ] Lazarus , whom Jesus raised from among [ the ] dead . <EOV> <SOV> There therefore they made him a supper , and Martha served , but Lazarus was one of those at table with him . <EOV> <SOV> Mary therefore , having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price , anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair , and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> One of his disciples therefore , Judas [ son ] of Simon , Iscariote , who was about to deliver him up , says , <EOV> <SOV> Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor ? <EOV> <SOV> But he said this , not that he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief and had the bag , and carried what was put into [ it ] . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said , Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial ; <EOV> <SOV> for ye have the poor always with you , but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there ; and they came , not because of Jesus only , but also that they might see Lazarus whom he raised from among [ the ] dead . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus also , <EOV> <SOV> because many of the Jews went away on his account and believed on Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast , having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> took branches of palms and went out to meet him , and cried , Hosanna , blessed [ is ] he that comes in the name of [ the ] Lord , the King of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having found a young ass , sat upon it ; as it is written , <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , daughter of Zion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt . <EOV> <SOV> [ Now ] his disciples knew not these things at the first ; but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things to him . <EOV> <SOV> The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because he had called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from among [ the ] dead . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said to one another , Ye see that ye profit nothing : behold , the world is gone after him . <EOV> <SOV> And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that they might worship in the feast ; <EOV> <SOV> these therefore came to Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and they asked him saying , Sir , we desire to see Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Philip comes and tells Andrew , [ and again ] Andrew comes and Philip , and they tell Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered them saying , The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die , it abides alone ; but if it die , it bears much fruit . <EOV> <SOV> He that loves his life shall lose it , and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> If any one serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there also shall be * my * servant . [ And ] if any one serve me , him shall the Father honour . <EOV> <SOV> Now is my soul troubled , and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour . But on account of this have I come to this hour . <EOV> <SOV> Father , glorify thy name . There came therefore a voice out of heaven , I both have glorified and will glorify [ it ] again . <EOV> <SOV> The crowd therefore , which stood [ there ] and heard [ it ] , said that it had thundered . Others said , An angel has spoken to him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said , Not on my account has this voice come , but on yours . <EOV> <SOV> Now is [ the ] judgment of this world ; now shall the prince of this world be cast out : <EOV> <SOV> and I , if I be lifted up out of the earth , will draw all to me . <EOV> <SOV> But this he said signifying by what death he was about to die . <EOV> <SOV> The crowd answered him , We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever ; and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up ? Who * is * this , the Son of man ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to them , Yet a little while is the light amongst you . Walk while ye have the light , that darkness may not overtake you . And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes . <EOV> <SOV> While ye have the light , believe in the light , that ye may become sons of light . Jesus said these things , and going away hid himself from them . <EOV> <SOV> But though he had done so many signs before them , they believed not on him , <EOV> <SOV> that the word of the prophet Esaias which he said might be fulfilled , Lord , who has believed our report ? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed ? <EOV> <SOV> On this account they could not believe , because Esaias said again , <EOV> <SOV> He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart , that they may not see with their eyes , and understand with their heart and be converted , and I should heal them . <EOV> <SOV> These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him . <EOV> <SOV> Although indeed from among the rulers also many believed on him , but on account of the Pharisees did not confess [ him ] , that they might not be put out of the synagogue : <EOV> <SOV> for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus cried and said , He that believes on me , believes not on me , but on him that sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> and he that beholds me , beholds him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> I am come into the world [ as ] light , that every one that believes on me may not abide in darkness ; <EOV> <SOV> and if any one hear my words and do not keep [ them ] , I judge him not , for I am not come that I might judge the world , but that I might save the world . <EOV> <SOV> He that rejects me and does not receive my words , has him who judges him : the word which I have spoken , that shall judge him in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For I have not spoken from myself , but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak ; <EOV> <SOV> and I know that his commandment is life eternal . What therefore I speak , as the Father has said to me , so I speak . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now before the feast of the passover , Jesus , knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , loved them to the end . <EOV> <SOV> And during supper , the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas [ son ] of Simon , Iscariote , that he should deliver him up , <EOV> <SOV> [ Jesus , ] knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands , and that he came out from God and was going to God , <EOV> <SOV> rises from supper and lays aside his garments , and having taken a linen towel he girded himself : <EOV> <SOV> then he pours water into the washhand basin , and began to wash the feet of the disciples , and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded . <EOV> <SOV> He comes therefore to Simon Peter ; and * he * says to him , Lord , dost thou wash * my * feet ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , What I do thou dost not know now , but thou shalt know hereafter . <EOV> <SOV> Peter says to him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , Unless I wash thee , thou hast not part with me . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter says to him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet , but is wholly clean ; and ye are clean , but not all . <EOV> <SOV> For he knew him that delivered him up : on account of this he said , Ye are not all clean . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , having sat down again , he said to them , Do ye know what I have done to you ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord , and ye say well , for I am [ so ] . <EOV> <SOV> If I therefore , the Lord and the Teacher , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another 's feet ; <EOV> <SOV> for I have given you an example that , as I have done to you , ye should do also . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , The bondman is not greater than his lord , nor the sent greater than he who has sent him . <EOV> <SOV> If ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them . <EOV> <SOV> I speak not of you all . I know those whom I have chosen ; but that the scripture might be fulfilled , He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me . <EOV> <SOV> I tell you [ it ] now before it happens , that when it happens , ye may believe that I am [ he ] . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me ; and he that receives me receives him who has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Having said these things , Jesus was troubled in spirit , and testified and said , Verily , verily , I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples therefore looked one on another , doubting of whom he spoke . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was at table one of his disciples in the bosom of Jesus , whom Jesus loved . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter makes a sign therefore to him to ask who it might be of whom he spoke . <EOV> <SOV> But he , leaning on the breast of Jesus , says to him , Lord , who is it ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answers , He it is to whom I , after I have dipped the morsel , give it . And having dipped the morsel , he gives it to Judas [ son ] of Simon , Iscariote . <EOV> <SOV> And , after the morsel , then entered Satan into him . Jesus therefore says to him , What thou doest , do quickly . <EOV> <SOV> But none of those at table knew why he said this to him ; <EOV> <SOV> for some supposed , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus was saying to him , Buy the things of which we have need for the feast ; or that he should give something to the poor . <EOV> <SOV> Having therefore received the morsel , he went out immediately ; and it was night . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he was gone out Jesus says , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him . <EOV> <SOV> If God be glorified in him , God also shall glorify him in himself , and shall glorify him immediately . <EOV> <SOV> Children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me ; and , as I said to the Jews , Where I go ye can not come , I say to you also now . <EOV> <SOV> A new commandment I give to you , that ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . <EOV> <SOV> By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine , if ye have love amongst yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter says to him , Lord , where goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Where I go thou canst not follow me now , but thou shalt follow me after . <EOV> <SOV> Peter says to him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answers , Thou wilt lay down thy life for me ! Verily , verily , I say to thee , The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Let not your heart be troubled ; ye believe on God , believe also on me . <EOV> <SOV> In my Father 's house there are many abodes ; were it not so , I had told you : for I go to prepare you a place ; <EOV> <SOV> and if I go and shall prepare you a place , I am coming again and shall receive you to myself , that where I am ye also may be . <EOV> <SOV> And ye know where I go , and ye know the way . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas says to him , Lord , we know not where thou goest , and how can we know the way ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , I am the way , and the truth , and the life . No one comes to the Father unless by me . <EOV> <SOV> If ye had known me , ye would have known also my Father , and henceforth ye know him and have seen him . <EOV> <SOV> Philip says to him , Lord , shew us the Father and it suffices us . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , Am I so long a time with you , and thou hast not known me , Philip ? He that has seen me has seen the Father ; and how sayest thou , Shew us the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> Believest thou not that I [ am ] in the Father , and that the Father is in me ? The words which I speak to you I do not speak from myself ; but the Father who abides in me , he does the works . <EOV> <SOV> Believe * me * that I [ am ] in the Father and the Father in me ; but if not , believe me for the works ' sake themselves . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , He that believes on me , the works which I do shall he do also , and he shall do greater than these , because I go to the Father . <EOV> <SOV> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , this will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son . <EOV> <SOV> If ye shall ask anything in my name , I will do it . <EOV> <SOV> If ye love me , keep my commandments . <EOV> <SOV> And I will beg the Father , and he will give you another Comforter , that he may be with you for ever , <EOV> <SOV> the Spirit of truth , whom the world can not receive , because it does not see him nor know him ; but ye know him , for he abides with you , and shall be in you . <EOV> <SOV> I will not leave you orphans , I am coming to you . <EOV> <SOV> Yet a little and the world sees me no longer ; but ye see me ; because I live ye also shall live . <EOV> <SOV> In that day ye shall know that I [ am ] in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you . <EOV> <SOV> He that has my commandments and keeps them , he it is that loves me ; but he that loves me shall be loved by my Father , and I will love him and will manifest myself to him . <EOV> <SOV> Judas , not the Iscariote , says to him , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself to us and not to the world ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , If any one love me , he will keep my word , and my Father will love him , and we will come to him and make our abode with him . <EOV> <SOV> He that loves me not does not keep my words ; and the word which ye hear is not mine , but [ that ] of the Father who has sent me . <EOV> <SOV> These things I have said to you , abiding with you ; <EOV> <SOV> but the Comforter , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , * he * shall teach you all things , and will bring to your remembrance all the things which I have said to you . <EOV> <SOV> I leave peace with you ; I give * my * peace to you : not as the world gives do I give to you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it fear . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that I have said unto you , I go away and I am coming to you . If ye loved me ye would rejoice that I go to the Father , for [ my ] Father is greater than I. <EOV> <SOV> And now I have told you before it comes to pass , that when it shall have come to pass ye may believe . <EOV> <SOV> I will no longer speak much with you , for the ruler of the world comes , and in me he has nothing ; <EOV> <SOV> but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father has commanded me , thus I do . Rise up , let us go hence . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman . <EOV> <SOV> [ As to ] every branch in me not bearing fruit , he takes it away ; and [ as to ] every one bearing fruit , he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you . <EOV> <SOV> Abide in me and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself unless it abide in the vine , thus neither [ can ] ye unless ye abide in me . <EOV> <SOV> I am the vine , ye [ are ] the branches . He that abides in me and I in him , * he * bears much fruit ; for without me ye can do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Unless any one abide in me he is cast out as the branch , and is dried up ; and they gather them and cast them into the fire , and they are burned . <EOV> <SOV> If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you . <EOV> <SOV> In this is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit , and ye shall become disciples of mine . <EOV> <SOV> As the Father has loved me , I also have loved you : abide in my love . <EOV> <SOV> If ye shall keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love , as I have kept my Father 's commandments and abide in his love . <EOV> <SOV> I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you , and your joy be full . <EOV> <SOV> This is my commandment , that ye love one another , as I have loved you . <EOV> <SOV> No one has greater love than this , that one should lay down his life for his friends . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you . <EOV> <SOV> I call you no longer bondmen , for the bondman does not know what his master is doing ; but I have called you friends , for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and have set you that ye should go and [ that ] ye should bear fruit , and [ that ] your fruit should abide , that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give you . <EOV> <SOV> These things I command you , that ye love one another . <EOV> <SOV> If the world hate you , know that it has hated me before you . <EOV> <SOV> If ye were of the world , the world would love its own ; but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , on account of this the world hates you . <EOV> <SOV> Remember the word which I said unto you , The bondman is not greater than his master . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my word , they will keep also yours . <EOV> <SOV> But they will do all these things to you on account of my name , because they have not known him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not come and spoken to them , they had not had sin ; but now they have no excuse for their sin . <EOV> <SOV> He that hates me hates also my Father . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not done among them the works which no other one has done , they had not had sin ; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father . <EOV> <SOV> But that the word written in their law might be fulfilled , They hated me without a cause . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father , * he * shall bear witness concerning me ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye too bear witness , because ye are with me from [ the ] beginning . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things I have spoken unto you that ye may not be offended . <EOV> <SOV> They shall put you out of the synagogues ; but the hour is coming that every one who kills you will think to render service to God ; <EOV> <SOV> and these things they will do because they have not known the Father nor me . <EOV> <SOV> But I have spoken these things to you , that when their hour shall have come , ye may remember them , that I have said [ them ] unto you . But I did not say these things unto you from [ the ] beginning , because I was with you . <EOV> <SOV> But now I go to him that has sent me , and none of you demands of me , Where goest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> But because I have spoken these things to you , sorrow has filled your heart . <EOV> <SOV> But I say the truth to you , It is profitable for you that I go away ; for if I do not go away , the Comforter will not come to you ; but if I go I will send him to you . <EOV> <SOV> And having come , he will bring demonstration to the world , of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment : <EOV> <SOV> of sin , because they do not believe on me ; <EOV> <SOV> of righteousness , because I go away to [ my ] Father , and ye behold me no longer ; <EOV> <SOV> of judgment , because the ruler of this world is judged . <EOV> <SOV> I have yet many things to say to you , but ye can not bear them now . <EOV> <SOV> But when * he * is come , the Spirit of truth , he shall guide you into all the truth : for he shall not speak from himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak ; and he will announce to you what is coming . <EOV> <SOV> He shall glorify me , for he shall receive of mine and shall announce [ it ] to you . <EOV> <SOV> All things that the Father has are mine ; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce [ it ] to you . <EOV> <SOV> A little while and ye do not behold me ; and again a little while and ye shall see me , [ because I go away to the Father ] . <EOV> <SOV> [ Some ] of his disciples therefore said to one another , What is this he says to us , A little while and ye do not behold me ; and again a little while and ye shall see me , and , Because I go away to the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore , What is this which he says [ of ] the little while ? We do not know [ of ] what he speaks . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus knew therefore that they desired to demand of him , and said to them , Do ye inquire of this among yourselves that I said , A little while and ye do not behold me ; and again a little while and ye shall see me ? <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to you , that ye shall weep and lament , ye , but the world shall rejoice ; and ye will be grieved , but your grief shall be turned to joy . <EOV> <SOV> A woman , when she gives birth to a child , has grief because her hour has come ; but when the child is born , she no longer remembers the trouble , on account of the joy that a man has been born into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And ye now therefore have grief ; but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one takes from you . <EOV> <SOV> And in that day ye shall demand nothing of me : verily , verily , I say to you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give you . <EOV> <SOV> Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full . <EOV> <SOV> These things I have spoken to you in allegories ; the hour is coming that I will no longer speak to you in allegories , but will declare to you openly concerning the Father . <EOV> <SOV> In that day ye shall ask in my name ; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you , <EOV> <SOV> for the Father himself has affection for you , because ye have had affection for me , and have believed that I came out from God . <EOV> <SOV> I came out from the Father and have come into the world ; again , I leave the world and go to the Father . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say to him , Lo , now thou speakest openly and utterest no allegory . <EOV> <SOV> Now we know that thou knowest all things , and hast not need that any one should demand of thee . By this we believe that thou art come from God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold , [ the ] hour is coming , and has come , that ye shall be scattered , each to his own , and shall leave me alone ; and [ yet ] I am not alone , for the Father is with me . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken to you that in me ye might have peace . In the world ye have tribulation ; but be of good courage : I have overcome the world . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things Jesus spoke , and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son may glorify thee ; <EOV> <SOV> as thou hast given him authority over all flesh , that [ as to ] all that thou hast given to him , he should give them life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the eternal life , that they should know thee , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent . <EOV> <SOV> I have glorified * thee * on the earth , I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it ; <EOV> <SOV> and now glorify * me * , * thou * Father , along with thyself , with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was . <EOV> <SOV> I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world . They were thine , and thou gavest them me , and they have kept thy word . <EOV> <SOV> Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee ; <EOV> <SOV> for the words which thou hast given me I have given them , and they have received [ them ] , and have known truly that I came out from thee , and have believed that thou sentest me . <EOV> <SOV> I demand concerning them ; I do not demand concerning the world , but concerning those whom thou hast given me , for they are thine , <EOV> <SOV> ( and all that is mine is thine , and [ all ] that is thine mine , ) and I am glorified in them . <EOV> <SOV> And I am no longer in the world , and these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep them in thy name which thou hast given me , that they may be one as we . <EOV> <SOV> When I was with them I kept them in thy name ; those thou hast given me I have guarded , and not one of them has perished , but the son of perdition , that the scripture might be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And now I come to thee . And these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in them . <EOV> <SOV> I have given them thy word , and the world has hated them , because they are not of the world , as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil . <EOV> <SOV> They are not of the world , as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Sanctify them by the truth : thy word is truth . <EOV> <SOV> As thou hast sent me into the world , I also have sent them into the world ; <EOV> <SOV> and I sanctify myself for them , that they also may be sanctified by truth . <EOV> <SOV> And I do not demand for these only , but also for those who believe on me through their word ; <EOV> <SOV> that they may be all one , as thou , Father , [ art ] in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us , that the world may believe that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them , that they may be one , as we are one ; <EOV> <SOV> I in them and thou in me , that they may be perfected into one [ and ] that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and [ that ] thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me . <EOV> <SOV> Father , [ as to ] those whom thou hast given me , I desire that where I am they also may be with me , that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me , for thou lovedst me before [ the ] foundation of [ the ] world . <EOV> <SOV> Righteous Father , -- and the world has not known thee , but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And I have made known to them thy name , and will make [ it ] known ; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Jesus , having said these things , went out with his disciples beyond the torrent Cedron , where was a garden , into which he entered , he and his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas also , who delivered him up , knew the place , because Jesus was often there , in company with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Judas therefore , having got the band , and officers of the chief priests and Pharisees , comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore , knowing all things that were coming upon him , went forth and said to them , Whom seek ye ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , Jesus the Nazaraean . Jesus says to them , I am [ he ] . And Judas also , who delivered him up , stood with them . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he said to them , I am [ he ] , they went away backward and fell to the ground . <EOV> <SOV> He demanded of them therefore again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus the Nazaraean . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I told you that I am [ he ] : if therefore ye seek me , let these go away ; <EOV> <SOV> that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke , [ As to ] those whom thou hast given me , I have not lost one of them . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and smote the bondman of the high priest and cut off his right ear ; and the bondman 's name was Malchus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to Peter , Put the sword into the sheath ; the cup which the Father has given me , shall I not drink it ? <EOV> <SOV> The band therefore , and the chiliarch , and the officers of the Jews , took Jesus and bound him : <EOV> <SOV> and they led him away to Annas first ; for he was father - in - law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year . <EOV> <SOV> But it was Caiaphas who counselled the Jews that it was better that one man should perish for the people . <EOV> <SOV> Now Simon Peter followed Jesus , and the other disciple . But that disciple was known to the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest ; <EOV> <SOV> but Peter stood at the door without . The other disciple therefore , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to the porteress and brought in Peter . <EOV> <SOV> The maid therefore , who was porteress , says to Peter , Art thou also of the disciples of this man ? He says , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> But the bondmen and officers , having made a fire of coals ( for it was cold ) , stood and warmed themselves ; and Peter was standing with them and warming himself . <EOV> <SOV> The high priest therefore demanded of Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , I spoke openly to the world ; I taught always in [ the ] synagogue and in the temple , where all the Jews come together , and in secret I have spoken nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Why demandest thou of me ? Demand of those who have heard , what I have spoken to them ; behold , they know what I have said . <EOV> <SOV> But as he said these things , one of the officers who stood by gave a blow on the face to Jesus , saying , Answerest thou the high priest thus ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil ; but if well , why smitest thou me ? <EOV> <SOV> Annas [ then ] had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest . <EOV> <SOV> But Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . They said therefore to him , Art thou also of his disciples ? He denied , and said , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> One of the bondmen of the high priest , who was kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off , says , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter denied therefore again , and immediately [ the ] cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> They lead therefore Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium ; and it was early morn . And * they * entered not into the praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but eat the passover . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore went out to them and said , What accusation do ye bring against this man ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , If this [ man ] were not an evildoer , we should not have delivered him up to thee . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore said to them , Take him , ye , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said to him , It is not permitted to us to put any one to death ; <EOV> <SOV> that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke , signifying what death he should die . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called Jesus , and said to him , Thou art the king of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered [ him ] , Dost thou say this of thyself , or have others said it to thee concerning me ? <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me : what hast thou done ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world ; if my kingdom were of this world , my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews ; but now my kingdom is not from hence . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore said to him , Thou art then a king ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest [ it ] , that I am a king . I have been born for this , and for this I have come into the world , that I might bear witness to the truth . Every one that is of the truth hears my voice . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate says to him , What is truth ? And having said this he went out again to the Jews , and says to them , I find no fault whatever in him . <EOV> <SOV> But ye have a custom that I release [ some ] one to you at the passover ; will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> They cried therefore again all , saying , Not this [ man ] , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged [ him ] . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head , and put a purple robe on him , <EOV> <SOV> and came to him and said , Hail , king of the Jews ! and gave him blows on the face . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate went out again and says to them , Lo , I bring him out to you , that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever . <EOV> <SOV> ( Jesus therefore went forth without , wearing the crown of thorn , and the purple robe . ) And he says to them , Behold the man ! <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying , Crucify , crucify [ him ] . Pilate says to them , Take him ye and crucify [ him ] , for I find no fault in him . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , We have a law , and according to [ our ] law he ought to die , because he made himself Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate therefore heard this word , he was the rather afraid , <EOV> <SOV> and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore says to him , Speakest thou not to * me * ? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above . On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [ the ] greater sin . <EOV> <SOV> From this time Pilate sought to release him ; but the Jews cried out saying , If thou releasest this [ man ] , thou art not a friend to Caesar . Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore , having heard these words , led Jesus out and sat down upon [ the ] judgment - seat , at a place called Pavement , but in Hebrew Gabbatha ; <EOV> <SOV> ( now it was [ the ] preparation of the passover ; it was about the sixth hour ; ) and he says to the Jews , Behold your king ! <EOV> <SOV> But they cried out , Take [ him ] away , take [ him ] away , crucify him . Pilate says to them , Shall I crucify your king ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar . <EOV> <SOV> Then therefore he delivered him up to them , that he might be crucified ; and they took Jesus and led him away . <EOV> <SOV> And he went out , bearing his cross , to the place called [ place ] of a skull , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha ; <EOV> <SOV> where they crucified him , and with him two others , [ one ] on this side , and [ one ] on that , and Jesus in the middle . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross . But there was written : Jesus the Nazaraean , the King of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> This title therefore many of the Jews read , for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near ; and it was written in Hebrew , Greek , Latin . <EOV> <SOV> The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , Do not write , The king of the Jews , but that * he * said , I am king of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , What I have written , I have written . <EOV> <SOV> The soldiers therefore , when they had crucified Jesus , took his clothes , and made four parts , to each soldier a part , and the body - coat ; but the body - coat was seamless , woven through the whole from the top . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to one another , Let us not rend it , but let us cast lots for it , whose it shall be ; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says , They parted my garments among themselves , and on my vesture they cast lots . The soldiers therefore did these things . <EOV> <SOV> And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother , and the sister of his mother , Mary the [ wife ] of Clopas , and Mary of Magdala . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore , seeing his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , says to his mother , Woman , behold thy son . <EOV> <SOV> Then he says unto the disciple , Behold thy mother . And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home . <EOV> <SOV> After this , Jesus , knowing that all things were now finished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , says , I thirst . <EOV> <SOV> There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar , and having filled a sponge with vinegar , and putting hyssop round it , they put it up to his mouth . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished ; and having bowed his head , he delivered up his spirit . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore , that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath , for it was [ the ] preparation , ( for the day of that sabbath was a great [ day ] , ) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away . <EOV> <SOV> The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him ; <EOV> <SOV> but coming to Jesus , when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs , <EOV> <SOV> but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and immediately there came out blood and water . <EOV> <SOV> And he who saw it bears witness , and his witness is true , and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe . <EOV> <SOV> For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled , Not a bone of him shall be broken . <EOV> <SOV> And again another scripture says , They shall look on him whom they pierced . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea , who was a disciple of Jesus , but secretly through fear of the Jews , demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus : and Pilate allowed it . He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Nicodemus also , who at first came to Jesus by night , came , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds [ weight ] . <EOV> <SOV> They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices , as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial . <EOV> <SOV> But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden , and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid . <EOV> <SOV> There therefore , on account of the preparation of the Jews , because the tomb was near , they laid Jesus . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And on the first [ day ] of the week Mary of Magdala comes in early morn to the tomb , while it was still dark , and sees the stone taken away from the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , to whom Jesus was attached , and says to them , They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> Peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and came to the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And the two ran together , and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter , and came first to the tomb , <EOV> <SOV> and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying ; he did not however go in . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore comes , following him , and entered into the tomb , and sees the linen cloths lying , <EOV> <SOV> and the handkerchief which was upon his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but folded up in a distinct place by itself . <EOV> <SOV> Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb , and he saw and believed ; <EOV> <SOV> for they had not yet known the scripture , that he must rise from among [ the ] dead . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples therefore went away again to their own home . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary stood at the tomb weeping without . As therefore she wept , she stooped down into the tomb , <EOV> <SOV> and beholds two angels sitting in white [ garments ] , one at the head and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain . <EOV> <SOV> And they say to her , Woman , why dost thou weep ? She says to them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing [ there ] , and knew not that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , Woman , why dost thou weep ? Whom seekest thou ? She , supposing that it was the gardener , says to him , Sir , if thou hast borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , Mary . She , turning round , says to him in Hebrew , Rabboni , which means Teacher . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to her , Touch me not , for I have not yet ascended to my Father ; but go to my brethren and say to them , I ascend to my Father and your Father , and [ to ] my God and your God . <EOV> <SOV> Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and [ that ] he had said these things to her . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore it was evening on that day , which was the first [ day ] of the week , and the doors shut where the disciples were , through fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and says to them , Peace [ be ] to you . <EOV> <SOV> And having said this , he shewed to them his hands and his side . The disciples rejoiced therefore , having seen the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> [ Jesus ] said therefore again to them , Peace [ be ] to you : as the Father sent me forth , I also send you . <EOV> <SOV> And having said this , he breathed into [ them ] , and says to them , Receive [ the ] Holy Spirit : <EOV> <SOV> whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted to them ; whose soever [ sins ] ye retain , they are retained . <EOV> <SOV> But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came . <EOV> <SOV> The other disciples therefore said to him , We have seen the Lord . But he said to them , Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails , and put my finger into the mark of the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> And eight days after , his disciples were again within , and Thomas with them . Jesus comes , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst and said , Peace [ be ] to you . <EOV> <SOV> Then he says to Thomas , Bring thy finger here and see my hands ; and bring thy hand and put it into my side ; and be not unbelieving , but believing . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas answered and said to him , My Lord and my God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed : blessed they who have not seen and have believed . <EOV> <SOV> Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples , which are not written in this book ; <EOV> <SOV> but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing ye might have life in his name . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias . And he manifested [ himself ] thus . <EOV> <SOV> There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee , and the [ sons ] of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter says to them , I go to fish . They say to him , We also come with thee . They went forth , and went on board , and that night took nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And early morn already breaking , Jesus stood on the shore ; the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore says to them , Children , have ye anything to eat ? They answered him , No . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find . They cast therefore , and they could no longer draw it , from the multitude of fishes . <EOV> <SOV> That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter , It is the Lord . Simon Peter therefore , having heard that it was the Lord , girded his overcoat [ on him ] ( for he was naked ) , and cast himself into the sea ; <EOV> <SOV> and the other disciples came in the small boat , for they were not far from the land , but somewhere about two hundred cubits , dragging the net of fishes . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore they went out on the land , they see a fire of coals there , and fish laid on it , and bread . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to them , Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes , a hundred and fifty - three ; and though there were so many , the net was not rent . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to them , Come [ and ] dine . But none of the disciples dared inquire of him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them , and the fish in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples , being risen from among [ the ] dead . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore they had dined , Jesus says to Simon Peter , Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? He says to him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I am attached to thee . He says to him , Feed my lambs . <EOV> <SOV> He says to him again a second time , Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , lovest thou me ? He says to him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I am attached to thee . He says to him , Shepherd my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> He says to him the third time , Simon , [ son ] of Jonas , art thou attached to me ? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time , Art thou attached to me ? and said to him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I am attached to thee . Jesus says to him , Feed my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say to thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst where thou desiredst ; but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and bring thee where thou dost not desire . <EOV> <SOV> But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God . And having said this , he says to him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> Peter , turning round , sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following , who also leaned at supper on his breast , and said , Lord , who is it that delivers thee up ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter , seeing him , says to Jesus , Lord , and what [ of ] this [ man ] ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus says to him , If I will that he abide until I come , what [ is that ] to thee ? Follow thou me . <EOV> <SOV> This word therefore went out among the brethren , That disciple does not die . And Jesus did not say to him , He does not die ; but , If I will that he abide until I come , what [ is that ] to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things , and who has written these things ; and we know that his witness is true . <EOV> <SOV> And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which if they were written one by one , I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written . <EOV> <EOC>
