<SOC> <SOV> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us , <EOV> <SOV> Even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ; <EOV> <SOV> It seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus , <EOV> <SOV> That thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed . <EOV> <SOV> THERE was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless . <EOV> <SOV> And they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that while he executed the priest 's office before God in the order of his course , <EOV> <SOV> According to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him . <EOV> <SOV> But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John . <EOV> <SOV> And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth . <EOV> <SOV> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost , even from his mother 's womb . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God . <EOV> <SOV> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias said unto the angel , Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak unto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season . <EOV> <SOV> And the people waited for Zacharias , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house . <EOV> <SOV> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men . <EOV> <SOV> And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth , <EOV> <SOV> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women . <EOV> <SOV> And when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favour with God . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name JESUS . <EOV> <SOV> He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David : <EOV> <SOV> And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Mary unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ? <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren . <EOV> <SOV> For with God nothing shall be impossible . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ; <EOV> <SOV> And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost : <EOV> <SOV> And she spake out with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . <EOV> <SOV> And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ? <EOV> <SOV> For , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord , <EOV> <SOV> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour . <EOV> <SOV> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed . <EOV> <SOV> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name . <EOV> <SOV> And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation . <EOV> <SOV> He hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts . <EOV> <SOV> He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree . <EOV> <SOV> He hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away . <EOV> <SOV> He hath holpen his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ; <EOV> <SOV> As he spake to our fathers , to Abraham , and to his seed for ever . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house . <EOV> <SOV> Now Elisabeth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son . <EOV> <SOV> And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father . <EOV> <SOV> And his mother answered and said , Not so ; but he shall be called John . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name . <EOV> <SOV> And they made signs to his father , how he would have him called . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , His name is John . And they marvelled all . <EOV> <SOV> And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised God . <EOV> <SOV> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea . <EOV> <SOV> And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! And the hand of the Lord was with him . <EOV> <SOV> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people , <EOV> <SOV> And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ; <EOV> <SOV> As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began : <EOV> <SOV> That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ; <EOV> <SOV> To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ; <EOV> <SOV> The oath which he sware to our father Abraham , <EOV> <SOV> That he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear , <EOV> <SOV> In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ; <EOV> <SOV> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins , <EOV> <SOV> Through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us , <EOV> <SOV> To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace . <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed . <EOV> <SOV> ( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . ) <EOV> <SOV> And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : ) <EOV> <SOV> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child . <EOV> <SOV> And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered . <EOV> <SOV> And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn . <EOV> <SOV> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night . <EOV> <SOV> And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said unto them , Fear not : for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people . <EOV> <SOV> For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And this shall be a sign unto you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us . <EOV> <SOV> And they came with haste , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child . <EOV> <SOV> And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called JESUS , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb . <EOV> <SOV> And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ; <EOV> <SOV> ( As it is written in the law of the LORD , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; ) <EOV> <SOV> And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law , <EOV> <SOV> Then took he him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said , <EOV> <SOV> Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word : <EOV> <SOV> For mine eyes have seen thy salvation , <EOV> <SOV> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ; <EOV> <SOV> A light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him . <EOV> <SOV> And Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ; <EOV> <SOV> ( Yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also , ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed . <EOV> <SOV> And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ; <EOV> <SOV> And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day . <EOV> <SOV> And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it . <EOV> <SOV> But they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance . <EOV> <SOV> And when they found him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions . <EOV> <SOV> And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that I must be about my Father 's business ? <EOV> <SOV> And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene , <EOV> <SOV> Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness . <EOV> <SOV> And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ; <EOV> <SOV> As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . <EOV> <SOV> Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ; <EOV> <SOV> And all flesh shall see the salvation of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? <EOV> <SOV> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> And the people asked him , saying , What shall we do then ? <EOV> <SOV> He answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise . <EOV> <SOV> Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , Master , what shall we do ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? And he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages . <EOV> <SOV> And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ; <EOV> <SOV> John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire : <EOV> <SOV> Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . <EOV> <SOV> And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people . <EOV> <SOV> But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip 's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done , <EOV> <SOV> Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison . <EOV> <SOV> Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened , <EOV> <SOV> And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Joanna , which was the son of Rhesa , which was the son of Zorobabel , which was the son of Salathiel , which was the son of Neri , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of Er , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of Salmon , which was the son of Naasson , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Jacob , which was the son of Isaac , which was the son of Abraham , which was the son of Thara , which was the son of Nachor , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Saruch , which was the son of Ragau , which was the son of Phalec , which was the son of Heber , which was the son of Sala , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan , <EOV> <SOV> Which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness , <EOV> <SOV> Being forty days tempted of the devil . And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it . <EOV> <SOV> If thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve . <EOV> <SOV> And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence : <EOV> <SOV> For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee : <EOV> <SOV> And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . <EOV> <SOV> And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read . <EOV> <SOV> And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias . And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written , <EOV> <SOV> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised , <EOV> <SOV> To preach the acceptable year of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to say unto them , This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears . <EOV> <SOV> And all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Ye will surely say unto me this proverb , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Verily I say unto you , No prophet is accepted in his own country . <EOV> <SOV> But I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ; <EOV> <SOV> But unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow . <EOV> <SOV> And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian . <EOV> <SOV> And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath , <EOV> <SOV> And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong . <EOV> <SOV> But he passing through the midst of them went his way , <EOV> <SOV> And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power . <EOV> <SOV> And in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art ; the Holy One of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out . <EOV> <SOV> And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . And Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her . <EOV> <SOV> And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also : for therefore am I sent . <EOV> <SOV> And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gennesaret , <EOV> <SOV> And saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets . <EOV> <SOV> And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . And he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake . <EOV> <SOV> And they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink . <EOV> <SOV> When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord . <EOV> <SOV> For he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken : <EOV> <SOV> And so was also James , and John , the sons of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing Jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them . <EOV> <SOV> But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities . <EOV> <SOV> And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ? <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , What reason ye in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to day . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And he left all , rose up , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them . <EOV> <SOV> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick . <EOV> <SOV> I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? <EOV> <SOV> But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old . <EOV> <SOV> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish . <EOV> <SOV> But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved . <EOV> <SOV> No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new : for he saith , The old is better . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ; <EOV> <SOV> How he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him . <EOV> <SOV> But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose and stood forth . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ? <EOV> <SOV> And looking round about upon them all , he said unto the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other . <EOV> <SOV> And they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon , ( whom he also named Peter , ) and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew , <EOV> <SOV> Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes , <EOV> <SOV> And Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , which also was the traitor . <EOV> <SOV> And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ; <EOV> <SOV> And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed . <EOV> <SOV> And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all . <EOV> <SOV> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you which hear , Love your enemies , do good to them which hate you , <EOV> <SOV> Bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you . <EOV> <SOV> And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also . <EOV> <SOV> Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise . <EOV> <SOV> For if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again . <EOV> <SOV> But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil . <EOV> <SOV> Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful . <EOV> <SOV> Judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven : <EOV> <SOV> Give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ? <EOV> <SOV> The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master . <EOV> <SOV> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . <EOV> <SOV> For every tree is known by his own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes . <EOV> <SOV> A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like : <EOV> <SOV> He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock . <EOV> <SOV> But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came to Jesus , they besought him instantly , saying , That he was worthy for whom he should do this : <EOV> <SOV> For he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof : <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> For I also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say unto one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not . <EOV> <SOV> And he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . And he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he delivered him to his mother . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a fear on all : and they glorified God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people . <EOV> <SOV> And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things . <EOV> <SOV> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ? <EOV> <SOV> When the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ? <EOV> <SOV> And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus answering said unto them , Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me . <EOV> <SOV> And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts . <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> This is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized of him . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ? <EOV> <SOV> They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept . <EOV> <SOV> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a devil . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners ! <EOV> <SOV> But wisdom is justified of all her children . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee 's house , brought an alabaster box of ointment , <EOV> <SOV> And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he saith , Master , say on . <EOV> <SOV> There was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ? <EOV> <SOV> Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . And he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged . <EOV> <SOV> And he turned to the woman , and said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thine house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head . <EOV> <SOV> Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet . <EOV> <SOV> My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him , <EOV> <SOV> And certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils , <EOV> <SOV> And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod 's steward , and Susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance . <EOV> <SOV> And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable : <EOV> <SOV> A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it . <EOV> <SOV> And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture . <EOV> <SOV> And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . And when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , What might this parable be ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand . <EOV> <SOV> Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God . <EOV> <SOV> Those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved . <EOV> <SOV> They on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away . <EOV> <SOV> And that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection . <EOV> <SOV> But that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience . <EOV> <SOV> No man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they which enter in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press . <EOV> <SOV> And it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . And they launched forth . <EOV> <SOV> But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . Then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Where is your faith ? And they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him . <EOV> <SOV> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs . <EOV> <SOV> When he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I beseech thee , torment me not . <EOV> <SOV> ( For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness . ) <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus asked him , saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : because many devils were entered into him . <EOV> <SOV> And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep . <EOV> <SOV> And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them . <EOV> <SOV> Then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked . <EOV> <SOV> When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country . <EOV> <SOV> Then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed . <EOV> <SOV> Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again . <EOV> <SOV> Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Return to thine own house , and shew how great things God hath done unto thee . And he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house : <EOV> <SOV> For he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . But as he went the people thronged him . <EOV> <SOV> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any , <EOV> <SOV> Came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Who touched me ? When all denied , Peter and they that were with him said , Master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Somebody hath touched me : for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me . <EOV> <SOV> And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace . <EOV> <SOV> While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden . <EOV> <SOV> And all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , Weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead . <EOV> <SOV> And he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , Maid , arise . <EOV> <SOV> And her spirit came again , and she arose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat . <EOV> <SOV> And her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece . <EOV> <SOV> And whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where . <EOV> <SOV> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> And of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod said , John have I beheaded : but who is this , of whom I hear such things ? And he desired to see him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . And he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida . <EOV> <SOV> And the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing . <EOV> <SOV> And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people . <EOV> <SOV> For they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down by fifties in a company . <EOV> <SOV> And they did so , and made them all sit down . <EOV> <SOV> Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> They answering said , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again . <EOV> <SOV> He said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answering said , The Christ of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it . <EOV> <SOV> For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ? <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father 's , and of the holy angels . <EOV> <SOV> But I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias : <EOV> <SOV> Who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said . <EOV> <SOV> While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child . <EOV> <SOV> And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him . <EOV> <SOV> And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men . <EOV> <SOV> But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying . <EOV> <SOV> Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him , <EOV> <SOV> And said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great . <EOV> <SOV> And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him . <EOV> <SOV> And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elias did ? <EOV> <SOV> But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . And they went to another village . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said he unto them , The harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest . <EOV> <SOV> Go your ways : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves . <EOV> <SOV> Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace be to this house . <EOV> <SOV> And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you : <EOV> <SOV> And heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say , <EOV> <SOV> Even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes . <EOV> <SOV> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell . <EOV> <SOV> He that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the seventy returned again with joy , saying , Lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you . <EOV> <SOV> Notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight . <EOV> <SOV> All things are delivered to me of my Father : and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him . <EOV> <SOV> And he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see : <EOV> <SOV> For I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> He said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live . <EOV> <SOV> But he , willing to justify himself , said unto Jesus , And who is my neighbour ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead . <EOV> <SOV> And by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him , <EOV> <SOV> And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee . <EOV> <SOV> Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , He that shewed mercy on him . Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house . <EOV> <SOV> And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word . <EOV> <SOV> But Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things : <EOV> <SOV> But one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth . <EOV> <SOV> Give us day by day our daily bread . <EOV> <SOV> And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , Friend , lend me three loaves ; <EOV> <SOV> For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ? <EOV> <SOV> Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ? <EOV> <SOV> If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them said , He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils . <EOV> <SOV> And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth . <EOV> <SOV> If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub . <EOV> <SOV> And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you . <EOV> <SOV> When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace : <EOV> <SOV> But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils . <EOV> <SOV> He that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth . <EOV> <SOV> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished . <EOV> <SOV> Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it . <EOV> <SOV> And when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet . <EOV> <SOV> For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here . <EOV> <SOV> The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here . <EOV> <SOV> No man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness . <EOV> <SOV> If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light . <EOV> <SOV> And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness . <EOV> <SOV> Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ? <EOV> <SOV> But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou reproachest us also . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them . <EOV> <SOV> Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute : <EOV> <SOV> That the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ; <EOV> <SOV> From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered . <EOV> <SOV> And as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things : <EOV> <SOV> Laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In the mean time , when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people , insomuch that they trode one upon another , he began to say unto his disciples first of all , Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy . <EOV> <SOV> For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do . <EOV> <SOV> But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him . <EOV> <SOV> Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ? <EOV> <SOV> But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> Also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God : <EOV> <SOV> But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say : <EOV> <SOV> For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the company said unto him , Master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man 's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully : <EOV> <SOV> And he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods . <EOV> <SOV> And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry . <EOV> <SOV> But God said unto him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ? <EOV> <SOV> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on . <EOV> <SOV> The life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment . <EOV> <SOV> Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ? <EOV> <SOV> And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ? <EOV> <SOV> If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ? <EOV> <SOV> Consider the lilies how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet I say unto you , that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . <EOV> <SOV> If then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind . <EOV> <SOV> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things . <EOV> <SOV> But rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth . <EOV> <SOV> For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . <EOV> <SOV> Let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ; <EOV> <SOV> And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them . <EOV> <SOV> And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants . <EOV> <SOV> And this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through . <EOV> <SOV> Be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter said unto him , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ? <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ? <EOV> <SOV> Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing . <EOV> <SOV> Of a truth I say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath . <EOV> <SOV> But and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ; <EOV> <SOV> The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers . <EOV> <SOV> And that servant , which knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes . <EOV> <SOV> But he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more . <EOV> <SOV> I am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will I , if it be already kindled ? <EOV> <SOV> But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished ! <EOV> <SOV> Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division : <EOV> <SOV> For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three . <EOV> <SOV> The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law . <EOV> <SOV> And he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it is . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it cometh to pass . <EOV> <SOV> Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ? <EOV> <SOV> Yea , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ? <EOV> <SOV> When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison . <EOV> <SOV> I tell thee , thou shalt not depart thence , till thou hast paid the very last mite . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans , whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto them , Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans , because they suffered such things ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish . <EOV> <SOV> Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish . <EOV> <SOV> He spake also this parable ; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it : <EOV> <SOV> And if it bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity . <EOV> <SOV> And he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God . <EOV> <SOV> And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day . <EOV> <SOV> The Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ? <EOV> <SOV> And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I resemble it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it . <EOV> <SOV> And again he said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . <EOV> <SOV> And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ? And he said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> Strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , I say unto you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able . <EOV> <SOV> When once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , Lord , open unto us ; and he shall answer and say unto you , I know you not whence ye are : <EOV> <SOV> Then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets . <EOV> <SOV> But he shall say , I tell you , I know you not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last . <EOV> <SOV> The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it can not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not ! <EOV> <SOV> Behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ; <EOV> <SOV> And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ? <EOV> <SOV> And they could not answer him again to these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them . <EOV> <SOV> When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ; <EOV> <SOV> And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he also to him that bade him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind : <EOV> <SOV> And thou shalt be blessed ; for they can not recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just . <EOV> <SOV> And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he unto him , A certain man made a great supper , and bade many : <EOV> <SOV> And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for all things are now ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come . <EOV> <SOV> So that servant came , and shewed his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper . <EOV> <SOV> And there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> For which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ? <EOV> <SOV> Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish . <EOV> <SOV> Or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ? <EOV> <SOV> Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace . <EOV> <SOV> So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ? <EOV> <SOV> It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake this parable unto them , saying , <EOV> <SOV> What man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing . <EOV> <SOV> And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> I say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance . <EOV> <SOV> Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ? <EOV> <SOV> And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A certain man had two sons : <EOV> <SOV> And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his living . <EOV> <SOV> And not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want . <EOV> <SOV> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine . <EOV> <SOV> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger ! <EOV> <SOV> I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee , <EOV> <SOV> And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son . <EOV> <SOV> But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet : <EOV> <SOV> And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry : <EOV> <SOV> For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry . <EOV> <SOV> Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing . <EOV> <SOV> And he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound . <EOV> <SOV> And he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and intreated him . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends : <EOV> <SOV> But as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine . <EOV> <SOV> It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods . <EOV> <SOV> And he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward . <EOV> <SOV> Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I can not dig ; to beg I am ashamed . <EOV> <SOV> I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses . <EOV> <SOV> So he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , An hundred measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , An hundred measures of wheat . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations . <EOV> <SOV> He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ? <EOV> <SOV> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man 's , who shall give you that which is your own ? <EOV> <SOV> No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God . <EOV> <SOV> The law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it . <EOV> <SOV> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day : <EOV> <SOV> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores , <EOV> <SOV> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into Abraham 's bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried ; <EOV> <SOV> And in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom . <EOV> <SOV> And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented . <EOV> <SOV> And beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you can not ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father 's house : <EOV> <SOV> For I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment . <EOV> <SOV> Abraham saith unto him , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then said he unto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come ! <EOV> <SOV> It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you . <EOV> <SOV> But which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ? <EOV> <SOV> And will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? I trow not . <EOV> <SOV> So likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off : <EOV> <SOV> And they lifted up their voices , and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God , <EOV> <SOV> And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ? <EOV> <SOV> There are not found that returned to give glory to God , save this stranger . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation : <EOV> <SOV> Neither shall they say , Lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of God is within you . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them . <EOV> <SOV> For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day . <EOV> <SOV> But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> They did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ; <EOV> <SOV> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all . <EOV> <SOV> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed . <EOV> <SOV> In that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back . <EOV> <SOV> Remember Lot 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it . <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left . <EOV> <SOV> Two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left . <EOV> <SOV> Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered and said unto him , Where , Lord ? And he said unto them , Wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he spake a parable unto them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying , There was in a city a judge , which feared not God , neither regarded man : <EOV> <SOV> And there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary . <EOV> <SOV> And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ; <EOV> <SOV> Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith . <EOV> <SOV> And shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ? <EOV> <SOV> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others : <EOV> <SOV> Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican . <EOV> <SOV> I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all that I possess . <EOV> <SOV> And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is , God . <EOV> <SOV> Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , All these have I kept from my youth up . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus heard these things , he said unto him , Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they that heard it said , Who then can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter said , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake , <EOV> <SOV> Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting . <EOV> <SOV> Then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished . <EOV> <SOV> For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on : <EOV> <SOV> And they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging : <EOV> <SOV> And hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant . <EOV> <SOV> And they told him , that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by . <EOV> <SOV> And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , Thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich . <EOV> <SOV> And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature . <EOV> <SOV> And he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord : Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return . <EOV> <SOV> And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come . <EOV> <SOV> But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities . <EOV> <SOV> And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said likewise to him , Be thou also over five cities . <EOV> <SOV> And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin : <EOV> <SOV> For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow : <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> ( And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds . ) <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , That unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him . <EOV> <SOV> But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , The Lord hath need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon . <EOV> <SOV> And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes . <EOV> <SOV> For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side , <EOV> <SOV> And shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation . <EOV> <SOV> And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him , <EOV> <SOV> And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders , <EOV> <SOV> And spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me : <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ? <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ? <EOV> <SOV> But and if we say , Of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> Then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time . <EOV> <SOV> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him . <EOV> <SOV> But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . <EOV> <SOV> So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ? <EOV> <SOV> He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid . <EOV> <SOV> And he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ? <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly : <EOV> <SOV> Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or no ? <EOV> <SOV> But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? <EOV> <SOV> Shew me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered and said , Caesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar 's , and unto God the things which be God 's . <EOV> <SOV> And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him certain of the Sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man 's brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . <EOV> <SOV> There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children . <EOV> <SOV> And the second took her to wife , and he died childless . <EOV> <SOV> And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died . <EOV> <SOV> Last of all the woman died also . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage : <EOV> <SOV> But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage : <EOV> <SOV> Neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection . <EOV> <SOV> Now that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . <EOV> <SOV> For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Then certain of the scribes answering said , Master , thou hast well said . <EOV> <SOV> And after that they durst not ask him any question at all . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , How say they that Christ is David 's son ? <EOV> <SOV> And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , <EOV> <SOV> Till I make thine enemies thy footstool . <EOV> <SOV> David therefore calleth him Lord , how is he then his son ? <EOV> <SOV> Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ; <EOV> <SOV> Which devour widows ' houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury . <EOV> <SOV> And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all : <EOV> <SOV> For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had . <EOV> <SOV> And as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said , <EOV> <SOV> As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : <EOV> <SOV> And great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> And it shall turn to you for a testimony . <EOV> <SOV> Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer : <EOV> <SOV> For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> But there shall not an hair of your head perish . <EOV> <SOV> In your patience possess ye your souls . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh . <EOV> <SOV> Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto . <EOV> <SOV> For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ; <EOV> <SOV> Men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake to them a parable ; Behold the fig tree , and all the trees ; <EOV> <SOV> When they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand . <EOV> <SOV> So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> And take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares . <EOV> <SOV> For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth . <EOV> <SOV> Watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> And in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , for to hear him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people . <EOV> <SOV> Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money . <EOV> <SOV> And he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare us the passover , that we may eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer : <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves : <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come . <EOV> <SOV> And he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you . <EOV> <SOV> But , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table . <EOV> <SOV> And truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed ! <EOV> <SOV> And they began to enquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing . <EOV> <SOV> And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors . <EOV> <SOV> But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve . <EOV> <SOV> For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations . <EOV> <SOV> And I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ; <EOV> <SOV> That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat : <EOV> <SOV> But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Lord , I am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough . <EOV> <SOV> And he came out , and went , as he was wo nt , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone 's cast , and kneeled down , and prayed , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven , strengthening him . <EOV> <SOV> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow , <EOV> <SOV> And said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ? <EOV> <SOV> When they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ? <EOV> <SOV> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ? <EOV> <SOV> When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . <EOV> <SOV> Then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest 's house . And Peter followed afar off . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he denied him , saying , Woman , I know him not . <EOV> <SOV> And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou art also of them . And Peter said , Man , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter went out , and wept bitterly . <EOV> <SOV> And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him . <EOV> <SOV> And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Art thou the Christ ? tell us . And he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe : <EOV> <SOV> And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go . <EOV> <SOV> Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said unto them , Ye say that I am . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , What need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the whole multitude of them arose , and led him unto Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ a King . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said , Thou sayest it . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people , I find no fault in this man . <EOV> <SOV> And they were the more fierce , saying , He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Jewry , beginning from Galilee to this place . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time . <EOV> <SOV> And when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him . <EOV> <SOV> Then he questioned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people , <EOV> <SOV> Said unto them , Ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him : <EOV> <SOV> No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him . <EOV> <SOV> I will therefore chastise him , and release him . <EOV> <SOV> ( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast . ) <EOV> <SOV> And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas : <EOV> <SOV> ( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . ) <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore , willing to release Jesus , spake again to them . <EOV> <SOV> But they cried , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore chastise him , and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> And they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required . <EOV> <SOV> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will . <EOV> <SOV> And as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed and lamented him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus turning unto them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children . <EOV> <SOV> For , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us . <EOV> <SOV> For if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ? <EOV> <SOV> And there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus , Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . And they parted his raiment , and cast lots . <EOV> <SOV> And the people stood beholding . And the rulers also with them derided him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if he be Christ , the chosen of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , If thou be the king of the Jews , save thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us . <EOV> <SOV> But the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ? <EOV> <SOV> And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto Jesus , Lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , To day shalt thou be with me in paradise . <EOV> <SOV> And it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour . <EOV> <SOV> And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned . <EOV> <SOV> And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counsellor ; and he was a good man , and a just : <EOV> <SOV> ( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> This man went unto Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid . <EOV> <SOV> And that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on . <EOV> <SOV> And the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid . <EOV> <SOV> And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the sepulchre , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them . <EOV> <SOV> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> And they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments : <EOV> <SOV> And as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And they remembered his words , <EOV> <SOV> And returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest . <EOV> <SOV> It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles . <EOV> <SOV> And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not . <EOV> <SOV> Then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs . <EOV> <SOV> And they talked together of all these things which had happened . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them . <EOV> <SOV> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ? <EOV> <SOV> And the one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , What things ? And they said unto him , Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people : <EOV> <SOV> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him . <EOV> <SOV> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done . <EOV> <SOV> Yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ; <EOV> <SOV> And when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , which said that he was alive . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said unto them , O fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken : <EOV> <SOV> Ought not Christ to have suffered these things , and to enter into his glory ? <EOV> <SOV> And beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself . <EOV> <SOV> And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further . <EOV> <SOV> But they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . And he went in to tarry with them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them . <EOV> <SOV> And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight . <EOV> <SOV> And they said one to another , Did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ? <EOV> <SOV> And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon . <EOV> <SOV> And they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread . <EOV> <SOV> And as they thus spake , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you . <EOV> <SOV> But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet . <EOV> <SOV> And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here any meat ? <EOV> <SOV> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb . <EOV> <SOV> And he took it , and did eat before them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , These are the words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures , <EOV> <SOV> And said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day : <EOV> <SOV> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And ye are witnesses of these things . <EOV> <SOV> And , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high . <EOV> <SOV> And he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy : <EOV> <SOV> And were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
