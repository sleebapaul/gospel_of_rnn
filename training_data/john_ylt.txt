<SOC> <SOV> In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God ; <EOV> <SOV> this one was in the beginning with God ; <EOV> <SOV> all things through him did happen , and without him happened not even one thing that hath happened . <EOV> <SOV> In him was life , and the life was the light of men , <EOV> <SOV> and the light in the darkness did shine , and the darkness did not perceive it . <EOV> <SOV> There came a man -- having been sent from God -- whose name ' is ' John , <EOV> <SOV> this one came for testimony , that he might testify about the Light , that all might believe through him ; <EOV> <SOV> that one was not the Light , but -- that he might testify about the Light . <EOV> <SOV> He was the true Light , which doth enlighten every man , coming to the world ; <EOV> <SOV> in the world he was , and the world through him was made , and the world did not know him : <EOV> <SOV> to his own things he came , and his own people did not receive him ; <EOV> <SOV> but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to become sons of God -- to those believing in his name , <EOV> <SOV> who -- not of blood nor of a will of flesh , nor of a will of man but -- of God were begotten . <EOV> <SOV> And the Word became flesh , and did tabernacle among us , and we beheld his glory , glory as of an only begotten of a father , full of grace and truth . <EOV> <SOV> John doth testify concerning him , and hath cried , saying , ' This was he of whom I said , He who after me is coming , hath come before me , for he was before me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and out of his fulness did we all receive , and grace over - against grace ; <EOV> <SOV> for the law through Moses was given , the grace and the truth through Jesus Christ did come ; <EOV> <SOV> God no one hath ever seen ; the only begotten Son , who is on the bosom of the Father -- he did declare . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the testimony of John , when the Jews sent out of Jerusalem priests and Levites , that they might question him , ' Who art thou ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he confessed and did not deny , and confessed -- ' I am not the Christ . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they questioned him , ' What then ? Elijah art thou ? ' and he saith , ' I am not . ' -- ' The prophet art thou ? ' and he answered , ' No . ' <EOV> <SOV> They said then to him , ' Who art thou , that we may give an answer to those sending us ? what dost thou say concerning thyself ? ' <EOV> <SOV> He said , ' I ' am ' a voice of one crying in the wilderness : Make straight the way of the Lord , as said Isaiah the prophet . ' <EOV> <SOV> And those sent were of the Pharisees , <EOV> <SOV> and they questioned him and said to him , ' Why , then , dost thou baptize , if thou art not the Christ , nor Elijah , nor the prophet ? ' <EOV> <SOV> John answered them , saying , ' I baptize with water , but in midst of you he hath stood whom ye have not known , this one it is who is coming after me , who hath been before me , <EOV> <SOV> of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his sandal . ' <EOV> <SOV> These things came to pass in Bethabara , beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing , <EOV> <SOV> on the morrow John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , ' Lo , the Lamb of God , who is taking away the sin of the world ; <EOV> <SOV> this is he concerning whom I said , After me doth come a man , who hath come before me , because he was before me : <EOV> <SOV> and I knew him not , but , that he might be manifested to Israel , because of this I came with the water baptizing . <EOV> <SOV> And John testified , saying -- ' I have seen the Spirit coming down , as a dove , out of heaven , and it remained on him ; <EOV> <SOV> and I did not know him , but he who sent me to baptize with water , He said to me , On whomsoever thou mayst see the Spirit coming down , and remaining on him , this is he who is baptizing with the Holy Spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> and I have seen , and have testified , that this is the Son of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow , again , John was standing , and two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and having looked on Jesus walking , he saith , ' Lo , the Lamb of God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and the two disciples heard him speaking , and they followed Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having turned , and having beheld them following , saith to them , ' What seek ye ? ' and they said to them , ' Rabbi , ( which is , being interpreted , Teacher , ) where remainest thou ? ' <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , ' Come and see ; ' they came , and saw where he doth remain , and with him they remained that day and the hour was about the tenth . <EOV> <SOV> Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who heard from John , and followed him ; <EOV> <SOV> this one doth first find his own brother Simon , and saith to him , ' We have found the Messiah , ' ( which is , being interpreted , The Anointed , ) <EOV> <SOV> and he brought him unto Jesus : and having looked upon him , Jesus saith , ' Thou art Simon , the son of Jonas , thou shalt be called Cephas , ' ( which is interpreted , A rock . ) <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow , he willed to go forth to Galilee , and he findeth Philip , and saith to him , ' Be following me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter ; <EOV> <SOV> Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith to him , ' Him of whom Moses wrote in the Law , and the prophets , we have found , Jesus the son of Joseph , who ' is ' from Nazareth ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Nathanael said to him , ' Out of Nazareth is any good thing able to be ? ' Philip said to him , ' Come and see . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him , and he saith concerning him , ' Lo , truly an Israelite , in whom guile is not ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael saith to him , ' Whence me dost thou know ? ' Jesus answered and said to him , ' Before Philip 's calling thee -- thou being under the fig - tree -- I saw thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael answered and saith to him , ' Rabbi , thou art the Son of God , thou art the king of Israel . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , ' Because I said to thee , I saw thee under the fig - tree , thou dost believe ; greater things than these thou shalt see ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to him , ' Verily , verily , I say to you , henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened , and the messengers of God going up and coming down upon the Son of Man . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee , and the mother of Jesus was there , <EOV> <SOV> and also Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage ; <EOV> <SOV> and wine having failed , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , ' Wine they have not ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' What -- to me and to thee , woman ? not yet is mine hour come . ' <EOV> <SOV> His mother saith to the ministrants , ' Whatever he may say to you -- do . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there were there six water - jugs of stone , placed according to the purifying of the Jews , holding each two or three measures . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , ' Fill the water - jugs with water ; ' and they filled them -- unto the brim ; <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' Draw out , now , and bear to the director of the apartment ; ' and they bare . <EOV> <SOV> And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine , and knew not whence it is , ( but the ministrants knew , who have drawn the water , ) the director of the feast doth call the bridegroom , <EOV> <SOV> and saith to him , ' Every man , at first , the good wine doth set forth ; and when they may have drunk freely , then the inferior ; thou didst keep the good wine till now . ' <EOV> <SOV> This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested his glory , and his disciples believed in him ; <EOV> <SOV> after this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples ; and there they remained not many days . <EOV> <SOV> And the passover of the Jews was nigh , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> and he found in the temple those selling oxen , and sheep , and doves , and the money - changers sitting , <EOV> <SOV> and having made a whip of small cords , he put all forth out of the temple , also the sheep , and the oxen ; and of the money - changers he poured out the coins , and the tables he overthrew , <EOV> <SOV> and to those selling the doves he said , ' Take these things hence ; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise . ' <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples remembered that it is written , ' The zeal of Thy house did eat me up ; ' <EOV> <SOV> the Jews then answered and said to him , ' What sign dost thou shew to us -- that thou dost these things ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , ' Destroy this sanctuary , and in three days I will raise it up . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , said , ' Forty and six years was this sanctuary building , and wilt thou in three days raise it up ? ' <EOV> <SOV> but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body ; <EOV> <SOV> when , then , he was raised out of the dead , his disciples remembered that he said this to them , and they believed the Writing , and the word that Jesus said . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was in Jerusalem , in the passover , in the feast , many believed in his name , beholding his signs that he was doing ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them , because of his knowing all ' men ' , <EOV> <SOV> and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man , for he himself was knowing what was in man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And there was a man of the Pharisees , Nicodemus his name , a ruler of the Jews , <EOV> <SOV> this one came unto him by night , and said to him , ' Rabbi , we have known that from God thou hast come -- a teacher , for no one these signs is able to do that thou dost , if God may not be with him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , ' Verily , verily , I say to thee , If any one may not be born from above , he is not able to see the reign of God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith unto him , ' How is a man able to be born , being old ? is he able into the womb of his mother a second time to enter , and to be born ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' Verily , verily , I say to thee , If any one may not be born of water , and the Spirit , he is not able to enter into the reign of God ; <EOV> <SOV> that which hath been born of the flesh is flesh , and that which hath been born of the Spirit is spirit . <EOV> <SOV> ' Thou mayest not wonder that I said to thee , It behoveth you to be born from above ; <EOV> <SOV> the Spirit where he willeth doth blow , and his voice thou dost hear , but thou hast not known whence he cometh , and whither he goeth ; thus is every one who hath been born of the Spirit . ' <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus answered and said to him , ' How are these things able to happen ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , ' Thou art the teacher of Israel -- and these things thou dost not know ! <EOV> <SOV> ' Verily , verily , I say to thee -- What we have known we speak , and what we have seen we testify , and our testimony ye do not receive ; <EOV> <SOV> if the earthly things I said to you , and ye do not believe , how , if I shall say to you the heavenly things , will ye believe ? <EOV> <SOV> and no one hath gone up to the heaven , except he who out of the heaven came down -- the Son of Man who is in the heaven . <EOV> <SOV> ' And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness , so it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up , <EOV> <SOV> that every one who is believing in him may not perish , but may have life age - during , <EOV> <SOV> for God did so love the world , that His Son -- the only begotten -- He gave , that every one who is believing in him may not perish , but may have life age - during . <EOV> <SOV> For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world , but that the world may be saved through him ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is believing in him is not judged , but he who is not believing hath been judged already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> ' And this is the judgment , that the light hath come to the world , and men did love the darkness rather than the light , for their works were evil ; <EOV> <SOV> for every one who is doing wicked things hateth the light , and doth not come unto the light , that his works may not be detected ; <EOV> <SOV> but he who is doing the truth doth come to the light , that his works may be manifested , that in God they are having been wrought . ' <EOV> <SOV> After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea , and there he did tarry with them , and was baptizing ; <EOV> <SOV> and John was also baptizing in Aenon , nigh to Salem , because there were many waters there , and they were coming and were being baptized -- <EOV> <SOV> for John was not yet cast into the prison -- <EOV> <SOV> there arose then a question from the disciples of John with ' some ' Jews about purifying , <EOV> <SOV> and they came unto John , and said to him , ' Rabbi , he who was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou didst testify , lo , this one is baptizing , and all are coming unto him . ' <EOV> <SOV> John answered and said , ' A man is not able to receive anything , if it may not have been given him from the heaven ; <EOV> <SOV> ye yourselves do testify to me that I said , I am not the Christ , but , that I am having been sent before him ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is having the bride is bridegroom , and the friend of the bridegroom , who is standing and hearing him , with joy doth rejoice because of the voice of the bridegroom ; this , then , my joy hath been fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> ' Him it behoveth to increase , and me to become less ; <EOV> <SOV> he who from above is coming is above all ; he who is from the earth , from the earth he is , and from the earth he speaketh ; he who from the heaven is coming is above all . <EOV> <SOV> ' And what he hath seen and heard this he doth testify , and his testimony none receiveth ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is receiving his testimony did seal that God is true ; <EOV> <SOV> for he whom God sent , the sayings of God he speaketh ; for not by measure doth God give the Spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> the Father doth love the Son , and all things hath given into his hand ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is believing in the Son , hath life age - during ; and he who is not believing the Son , shall not see life , but the wrath of God doth remain upon him . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus more disciples doth make and baptize than John , <EOV> <SOV> ( though indeed Jesus himself was not baptizing , but his disciples , ) <EOV> <SOV> he left Judea and went away again to Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and it was behoving him to go through Samaria . <EOV> <SOV> He cometh , therefore , to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near to the place that Jacob gave to Joseph his son ; <EOV> <SOV> and there was there a well of Jacob . Jesus therefore having been weary from the journeying , was sitting thus on the well ; it was as it were the sixth hour ; <EOV> <SOV> there cometh a woman out of Samaria to draw water . Jesus saith to her , ' Give me to drink ; ' <EOV> <SOV> for his disciples were gone away to the city , that they may buy victuals ; <EOV> <SOV> the Samaritan woman therefore saith to him , ' How dost thou , being a Jew , ask drink from me , being a Samaritan woman ? ' for Jews have no dealing with Samaritans . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to her , ' If thou hadst known the gift of God , and who it is who is saying to thee , Give me to drink , thou wouldest have asked him , and he would have given thee living water . ' <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith to him , ' Sir , thou hast not even a vessel to draw with , and the well is deep ; whence , then , hast thou the living water ? <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who did give us the well , and himself out of it did drink , and his sons , and his cattle ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to her , ' Every one who is drinking of this water shall thirst again ; <EOV> <SOV> but whoever may drink of the water that I will give him , may not thirst -- to the age ; and the water that I will give him shall become in him a well of water , springing up to life age - during . ' <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , ' Sir , give me this water , that I may not thirst , nor come hither to draw . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' Go , call thy husband , and come hither ; ' <EOV> <SOV> the woman answered and said , ' I have not a husband . ' Jesus saith to her , ' Well didst thou say -- A husband I have not ; <EOV> <SOV> for five husbands thou hast had , and , now , he whom thou hast is not thy husband ; this hast thou said truly . ' <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith to him , ' Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet ; <EOV> <SOV> our fathers in this mountain did worship , and ye -- ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it behoveth to worship . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' Woman , believe me , that there doth come an hour , when neither in this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , shall ye worship the Father ; <EOV> <SOV> ye worship what ye have not known ; we worship what we have known , because the salvation is of the Jews ; <EOV> <SOV> but , there cometh an hour , and it now is , when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father also doth seek such to worship him ; <EOV> <SOV> God ' is ' a Spirit , and those worshipping Him , in spirit and truth it doth behove to worship . ' <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith to him , ' I have known that Messiah doth come , who is called Christ , when that one may come , he will tell us all things ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' I am ' he ' , who am speaking to thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And upon this came his disciples , and were wondering that with a woman he was speaking , no one , however , said , ' What seekest thou ? ' or ' Why speakest thou with her ? ' <EOV> <SOV> The woman then left her water - jug , and went away to the city , and saith to the men , <EOV> <SOV> ' Come , see a man , who told me all things -- as many as I did ; is this the Christ ? ' <EOV> <SOV> They went forth therefore out of the city , and were coming unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And in the meanwhile his disciples were asking him , saying , ' Rabbi , eat ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' I have food to eat that ye have not known . ' <EOV> <SOV> The disciples then said one to another , ' Did any one bring him anything to eat ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , ' My food is , that I may do the will of Him who sent me , and may finish His work ; <EOV> <SOV> do not say that it is yet four months , and the harvest cometh ; lo , I say to you , Lift up your eyes , and see the fields , that they are white unto harvest already . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he who is reaping doth receive a reward , and doth gather fruit to life age - during , that both he who is sowing and he who is reaping may rejoice together ; <EOV> <SOV> for in this the saying is the true one , that one is the sower and another the reaper . <EOV> <SOV> I sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured ; others laboured , and ye into their labour have entered . <EOV> <SOV> And from that city many believed in him , of the Samaritans , because of the word of the woman testifying , -- ' He told me all things -- as many as I did . ' <EOV> <SOV> When , then , the Samaritans came unto him , they were asking him to remain with them , and he remained there two days ; <EOV> <SOV> and many more did believe because of his word , <EOV> <SOV> and said to the woman -- ' No more because of thy speaking do we believe ; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ . ' <EOV> <SOV> And after the two days he went forth thence , and went away to Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> for Jesus himself testified that a prophet in his own country shall not have honour ; <EOV> <SOV> when then , he came to Galilee , the Galileans received him , having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem in the feast -- for they also went to the feast . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus came , therefore , again to Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine , and there was a certain courtier , whose son was ailing in Capernaum , <EOV> <SOV> he , having heard that Jesus is come out of Judea to Galilee , went away unto him , and was asking him that he may come down and may heal his son , for he was about to die . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus then said unto him , ' If signs and wonders ye may not see , ye will not believe . ' <EOV> <SOV> The courtier saith unto him , ' Sir , come down before my child die ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' Be going on ; thy son doth live . ' And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him , and was going on , <EOV> <SOV> and he now going down , his servants met him , and told , saying -- ' Thy child doth live ; ' <EOV> <SOV> he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better , and they said to him -- ' Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> then the father knew that ' it was ' in that hour in which Jesus said to him -- ' Thy son doth live , ' and he himself believed , and his whole house ; <EOV> <SOV> this again a second sign did Jesus , having come out of Judea to Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things there was a feast of the Jews , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-'gate ' a pool that is called in Hebrew Bethesda , having five porches , <EOV> <SOV> in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing , blind , lame , withered , waiting for the moving of the water , <EOV> <SOV> for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool , and was troubling the water , the first then having gone in after the troubling of the water , became whole of whatever sickness he was held . <EOV> <SOV> and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty and eight years , <EOV> <SOV> him Jesus having seen lying , and having known that he is already a long time , he saith to him , ' Dost thou wish to become whole ? ' <EOV> <SOV> The ailing man answered him , ' Sir , I have no man , that , when the water may be troubled , he may put me into the pool , and while I am coming , another doth go down before me . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' Rise , take up thy couch , and be walking ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately the man became whole , and he took up his couch , and was walking , and it was a sabbath on that day , <EOV> <SOV> the Jews then said to him that hath been healed , ' It is a sabbath ; it is not lawful to thee to take up the couch . ' <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , ' He who made me whole -- that one said to me , Take up thy couch , and be walking ; ' <EOV> <SOV> they questioned him , then , ' Who is the man who is saying to thee , Take up thy couch and be walking ? ' <EOV> <SOV> But he that was healed had not known who he is , for Jesus did move away , a multitude being in the place . <EOV> <SOV> After these things , Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said to him , ' Lo , thou hast become whole ; sin no more , lest something worse may happen to thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> The man went away , and told the Jews that it is Jesus who made him whole , <EOV> <SOV> and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus , and seeking to kill him , because these things he was doing on a sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered them , ' My Father till now doth work , and I work ; ' <EOV> <SOV> because of this , then , were the Jews seeking the more to kill him , because not only was he breaking the sabbath , but he also called God his own Father , making himself equal to God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore responded and said to them , ' Verily , verily , I say to you , The Son is not able to do anything of himself , if he may not see the Father doing anything ; for whatever things He may do , these also the Son in like manner doth ; <EOV> <SOV> for the Father doth love the Son , and doth shew to him all things that He himself doth ; and greater works than these He will shew him , that ye may wonder . <EOV> <SOV> ' For , as the Father doth raise the dead , and doth make alive , so also the Son doth make alive whom he willeth ; <EOV> <SOV> for neither doth the Father judge any one , but all the judgment He hath given to the Son , <EOV> <SOV> that all may honour the Son according as they honour the Father ; he who is not honouring the Son , doth not honour the Father who sent him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Verily , verily , I say to you -- He who is hearing my word , and is believing Him who sent me , hath life age - during , and to judgment he doth not come , but hath passed out of the death to the life . <EOV> <SOV> ' Verily , verily , I say to you -- There cometh an hour , and it now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God , and those having heard shall live ; <EOV> <SOV> for , as the Father hath life in himself , so He gave also to the Son to have life in himself , <EOV> <SOV> and authority He gave him also to do judgment , because he is Son of Man . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wonder not at this , because there doth come an hour in which all those in the tombs shall hear his voice , <EOV> <SOV> and they shall come forth ; those who did the good things to a rising again of life , and those who practised the evil things to a rising again of judgment . <EOV> <SOV> ' I am not able of myself to do anything ; according as I hear I judge , and my judgment is righteous , because I seek not my own will , but the will of the Father who sent me . <EOV> <SOV> ' If I testify concerning myself , my testimony is not true ; <EOV> <SOV> another there is who is testifying concerning me , and I have known that the testimony that he doth testify concerning me is true ; <EOV> <SOV> ye have sent unto John , and he hath testified to the truth . <EOV> <SOV> ' But I do not receive testimony from man , but these things I say that ye may be saved ; <EOV> <SOV> he was the burning and shining lamp , and ye did will to be glad , for an hour , in his light . <EOV> <SOV> ' But I have the testimony greater than John 's , for the works that the Father gave me , that I might finish them , the works themselves that I do , they testify concerning me , that the Father hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the Father who sent me Himself hath testified concerning me ; ye have neither heard His voice at any time , nor His appearance have ye seen ; <EOV> <SOV> and His word ye have not remaining in you , because whom He sent , him ye do not believe . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye search the Writings , because ye think in them to have life age - during , and these are they that are testifying concerning me ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye do not will to come unto me , that ye may have life ; <EOV> <SOV> glory from man I do not receive , <EOV> <SOV> but I have known you , that the love of God ye have not in yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> ' I have come in the name of my Father , and ye do not receive me ; if another may come in his own name , him ye will receive ; <EOV> <SOV> how are ye able -- ye -- to believe , glory from one another receiving , and the glory that ' is ' from God alone ye seek not ? <EOV> <SOV> ' Do not think that I will accuse you unto the Father ; there is who is accusing you , Moses -- in whom ye have hoped ; <EOV> <SOV> for if ye were believing Moses , ye would have been believing me , for he wrote concerning me ; <EOV> <SOV> but if his writings ye believe not , how shall ye believe my sayings ? ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee ( of Tiberias ) , <EOV> <SOV> and there was following him a great multitude , because they were seeing his signs that he was doing on the ailing ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus went up to the mount , and he was there sitting with his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and the passover was nigh , the feast of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus then having lifted up ' his ' eyes and having seen that a great multitude doth come to him , saith unto Philip , ' Whence shall we buy loaves , that these may eat ? ' -- <EOV> <SOV> and this he said , trying him , for he himself had known what he was about to do . <EOV> <SOV> Philip answered him , ' Two hundred denaries ' worth of loaves are not sufficient to them , that each of them may receive some little ; ' <EOV> <SOV> one of his disciples -- Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter -- saith to him , <EOV> <SOV> ' There is one little lad here who hath five barley loaves , and two fishes , but these -- what are they to so many ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' Make the men to sit down ; ' and there was much grass in the place , the men then sat down , in number , as it were , five thousand , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus took the loaves , and having given thanks he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to those reclining , in like manner , also of the little fishes as much as they wished . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were filled , he saith to his disciples , ' Gather together the broken pieces that are over , that nothing may be lost ; ' <EOV> <SOV> they gathered together , therefore , and filled twelve hand - baskets with broken pieces , from the five barley loaves that were over to those having eaten . <EOV> <SOV> The men , then , having seen the sign that Jesus did , said -- ' This is truly the Prophet , who is coming to the world ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , having known that they are about to come , and to take him by force that they may make him king , retired again to the mountain himself alone . <EOV> <SOV> And when evening came , his disciples went down to the sea , <EOV> <SOV> and having entered into the boat , they were going over the sea to Capernaum , and darkness had already come , and Jesus had not come unto them , <EOV> <SOV> the sea also -- a great wind blowing -- was being raised , <EOV> <SOV> having pushed onwards , therefore , about twenty - five or thirty furlongs , they behold Jesus walking on the sea , and coming nigh to the boat , and they were afraid ; <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' I am ' he ' , be not afraid ; ' <EOV> <SOV> they were willing then to receive him into the boat , and immediately the boat came unto the land to which they were going . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow , the multitude that was standing on the other side of the sea , having seen that there was no other little boat there except one -- that into which his disciples entered -- and that Jesus went not in with his disciples into the little boat , but his disciples went away alone , <EOV> <SOV> ( and other little boats came from Tiberias , nigh the place where they did eat the bread , the Lord having given thanks ) , <EOV> <SOV> when therefore the multitude saw that Jesus is not there , nor his disciples , they also themselves did enter into the boats , and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus ; <EOV> <SOV> and having found him on the other side of the sea , they said to him , ' Rabbi , when hast thou come hither ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them and said , ' Verily , verily , I say to you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw signs , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were satisfied ; <EOV> <SOV> work not for the food that is perishing , but for the food that is remaining to life age - during , which the Son of Man will give to you , for him did the Father seal -- ' even ' God . ' <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , ' What may we do that we may work the works of God ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , ' This is the work of God , that ye may believe in him whom He did send . ' <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore to him , ' What sign , then , dost thou , that we may see and may believe thee ? what dost thou work ? <EOV> <SOV> our fathers the manna did eat in the wilderness , according as it is having been written , Bread out of the heaven He gave them to eat . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to them , ' Verily , verily , I say to you , Moses did not give you the bread out of the heaven ; but my Father doth give you the true bread out of the heaven ; <EOV> <SOV> for the bread of God is that which is coming down out of the heaven , and giving life to the world . ' <EOV> <SOV> They said , therefore , unto him , ' Sir , always give us this bread . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , ' I am the bread of the life ; he who is coming unto me may not hunger , and he who is believing in me may not thirst -- at any time ; <EOV> <SOV> but I said to you , that ye also have seen me , and ye believe not ; <EOV> <SOV> all that the Father doth give to me will come unto me ; and him who is coming unto me , I may in no wise cast without , <EOV> <SOV> because I have come down out of the heaven , not that I may do my will , but the will of Him who sent me . <EOV> <SOV> ' And this is the will of the Father who sent me , that all that He hath given to me I may not lose of it , but may raise it up in the last day ; <EOV> <SOV> and this is the will of Him who sent me , that every one who is beholding the Son , and is believing in him , may have life age - during , and I will raise him up in the last day . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , were murmuring at him , because he said , ' I am the bread that came down out of the heaven ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said , ' Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we have known ? how then saith this one -- Out of the heaven I have come down ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , therefore , and said to them , ' Murmur not one with another ; <EOV> <SOV> no one is able to come unto me , if the Father who sent me may not draw him , and I will raise him up in the last day ; <EOV> <SOV> it is having been written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God ; every one therefore who heard from the Father , and learned , cometh to me ; <EOV> <SOV> not that any one hath seen the Father , except he who is from God , he hath seen the Father . <EOV> <SOV> ' Verily , verily , I say to you , He who is believing in me , hath life age - during ; <EOV> <SOV> I am the bread of the life ; <EOV> <SOV> your fathers did eat the manna in the wilderness , and they died ; <EOV> <SOV> this is the bread that out of the heaven is coming down , that any one may eat of it , and not die . <EOV> <SOV> ' I am the living bread that came down out of the heaven ; if any one may eat of this bread he shall live -- to the age ; and the bread also that I will give is my flesh , that I will give for the life of the world . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , were striving with one another , saying , ' How is this one able to give us ' his ' flesh to eat ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to them , ' Verily , verily , I say to you , If ye may not eat the flesh of the Son of Man , and may not drink his blood , ye have no life in yourselves ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is eating my flesh , and is drinking my blood , hath life age - during , and I will raise him up in the last day ; <EOV> <SOV> for my flesh truly is food , and my blood truly is drink ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is eating my flesh , and is drinking my blood , doth remain in me , and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> ' According as the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father , he also who is eating me , even that one shall live because of me ; <EOV> <SOV> this is the bread that came down out of the heaven ; not as your fathers did eat the manna , and died ; he who is eating this bread shall live -- to the age . ' <EOV> <SOV> These things he said in a synagogue , teaching in Capernaum ; <EOV> <SOV> many , therefore , of his disciples having heard , said , ' This word is hard ; who is able to hear it ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having known in himself that his disciples are murmuring about this , said to them , ' Doth this stumble you ? <EOV> <SOV> if then ye may behold the Son of Man going up where he was before ? <EOV> <SOV> the spirit it is that is giving life ; the flesh doth not profit anything ; the sayings that I speak to you are spirit , and they are life ; <EOV> <SOV> but there are certain of you who do not believe ; ' for Jesus had known from the beginning who they are who are not believing , and who is he who will deliver him up , <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' Because of this I have said to you -- No one is able to come unto me , if it may not have been given him from my Father . ' <EOV> <SOV> From this ' time ' many of his disciples went away backward , and were no more walking with him , <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to the twelve , ' Do ye also wish to go away ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter , therefore , answered him , ' Sir , unto whom shall we go ? thou hast sayings of life age - during ; <EOV> <SOV> and we have believed , and we have known , that thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , ' Did not I choose you -- the twelve ? and of you -- one is a devil . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake of Judas , Simon 's ' son ' , Iscariot , for he was about to deliver him up , being one of the twelve . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus was walking after these things in Galilee , for he did not wish to walk in Judea , because the Jews were seeking to kill him , <EOV> <SOV> and the feast of the Jews was nigh -- that of tabernacles -- <EOV> <SOV> his brethren , therefore , said unto him , ' Remove hence , and go away to Judea , that thy disciples also may behold thy works that thou dost ; <EOV> <SOV> for no one in secret doth anything , and himself seeketh to be in public ; if thou dost these things -- manifest thyself to the world ; ' <EOV> <SOV> for not even were his brethren believing in him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , saith to them , ' My time is not yet present , but your time is always ready ; <EOV> <SOV> the world is not able to hate you , but me it doth hate , because I testify concerning it that its works are evil . <EOV> <SOV> Ye -- go ye up to this feast ; I do not yet go up to this feast , because my time hath not yet been fulfilled ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and saying these things to them , he remained in Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And when his brethren went up , then also he himself went up to the feast , not manifestly , but as in secret ; <EOV> <SOV> the Jews , therefore , were seeking him , in the feast , and said , ' Where is that one ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and there was much murmuring about him among the multitudes , some indeed said -- ' He is good ; ' and others said , ' No , but he leadeth astray the multitude ; ' <EOV> <SOV> no one , however , was speaking freely about him , through fear of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> And it being now the middle of the feast , Jesus went up to the temple , and he was teaching , <EOV> <SOV> and the Jews were wondering , saying , ' How hath this one known letters -- not having learned ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them and said , ' My teaching is not mine , but His who sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> if any one may will to do His will , he shall know concerning the teaching , whether it is of God , or -- I do speak from myself . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is speaking from himself his own glory doth seek , but he who is seeking the glory of him who sent him , this one is true , and unrighteousness is not in him ; <EOV> <SOV> hath not Moses given you the law ? and none of you doth the law ; why me do ye seek to kill ? ' <EOV> <SOV> The multitude answered and said , ' Thou hast a demon , who doth seek to kill thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , ' One work I did , and ye all wonder , <EOV> <SOV> because of this , Moses hath given you the circumcision -- not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers -- and on a sabbath ye circumcise a man ; <EOV> <SOV> if a man doth receive circumcision on a sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken , are ye wroth with me that I made a man all whole on a sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> judge not according to appearance , but the righteous judgment judge . ' <EOV> <SOV> Certain , therefore , of the Jerusalemites said , ' Is not this he whom they are seeking to kill ? <EOV> <SOV> and , lo , he doth speak freely , and they say nothing to him ; did the rulers at all know truly that this is truly the Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> but this one -- we have known whence he is ; and the Christ , when he doth come , no one doth know whence he is . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus cried , therefore , in the temple , teaching and saying , ' Ye have both known me , and ye have known whence I am ; and I have not come of myself , but He who sent me is true , whom ye have not known ; <EOV> <SOV> and I have known Him , because I am from Him , and He did send me . ' <EOV> <SOV> They were seeking , therefore , to seize him , and no one laid the hand on him , because his hour had not yet come , <EOV> <SOV> and many out of the multitude did believe in him , and said -- ' The Christ -- when he may come -- will he do more signs than these that this one did ? ' <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him , and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they may take him ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to them , ' Yet a little time I am with you , and I go away unto Him who sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> ye will seek me , and ye shall not find ; and where I am , ye are not able to come . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , said among themselves , ' Whither is this one about to go that we shall not find him ? -- to the dispersion of the Greeks is he about to go ? and to teach the Greeks ; <EOV> <SOV> what is this word that he said , Ye will seek me , and ye shall not find ? and , Where I am , ye are not able to come ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And in the last , the great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , ' If any one doth thirst , let him come unto me and drink ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is believing in me , according as the Writing said , Rivers out of his belly shall flow of living water ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and this he said of the Spirit , which those believing in him were about to receive ; for not yet was the Holy Spirit , because Jesus was not yet glorified . <EOV> <SOV> Many , therefore out of the multitude , having heard the word , said , ' This is truly the Prophet ; ' <EOV> <SOV> others said , ' This is the Christ ; ' and others said , ' Why , out of Galilee doth the Christ come ? <EOV> <SOV> Did not the Writing say , that out of the seed of David , and from Bethlehem -- the village where David was -- the Christ doth come ? ' <EOV> <SOV> A division , therefore , arose among the multitude because of him . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of them were willing to seize him , but no one laid hands on him ; <EOV> <SOV> the officers came , therefore , unto the chief priests and Pharisees , and they said to them , ' Wherefore did ye not bring him ? ' <EOV> <SOV> The officers answered , ' Never so spake man -- as this man . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees , therefore , answered them , ' Have ye also been led astray ? <EOV> <SOV> did any one out of the rulers believe in him ? or out of the Pharisees ? <EOV> <SOV> but this multitude , that is not knowing the law , is accursed . ' <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith unto them -- he who came by night unto him -- being one of them , <EOV> <SOV> ' Doth our law judge the man , if it may not hear from him first , and know what he doth ? ' <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , ' Art thou also out of Galilee ? search and see , that a prophet out of Galilee hath not risen ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and each one went on to his house , but Jesus went on to the mount of the Olives . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And at dawn he came again to the temple , <EOV> <SOV> and all the people were coming unto him , and having sat down , he was teaching them ; <EOV> <SOV> and the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman having been taken in adultery , and having set her in the midst , <EOV> <SOV> they say to him , ' Teacher , this woman was taken in the very crime -- committing adultery , <EOV> <SOV> and in the law , Moses did command us that such be stoned ; thou , therefore , what dost thou say ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and this they said , trying him , that they might have to accuse him . And Jesus , having stooped down , with the finger he was writing on the ground , <EOV> <SOV> and when they continued asking him , having bent himself back , he said unto them , ' The sinless of you -- let him first cast the stone at her ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and again having stooped down , he was writing on the ground , <EOV> <SOV> and they having heard , and by the conscience being convicted , were going forth one by one , having begun from the elders -- unto the last ; and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having bent himself back , and having seen no one but the woman , said to her , ' Woman , where are those -- thine accusers ? did no one pass sentence upon thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and she said , ' No one , Sir ; ' and Jesus said to her , ' Neither do I pass sentence on thee ; be going on , and no more sin . ' <EOV> <SOV> Again , therefore , Jesus spake to them , saying , ' I am the light of the world ; he who is following me shall not walk in the darkness , but he shall have the light of the life . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees , therefore , said to him , ' Thou of thyself dost testify , thy testimony is not true ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , ' And if I testify of myself -- my testimony is true , because I have known whence I came , and whither I go , and ye -- ye have not known whence I come , or whither I go . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye according to the flesh do judge ; I do not judge any one , <EOV> <SOV> and even if I do judge my judgment is true , because I am not alone , but I and the Father who sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> and also in your law it hath been written , that the testimony of two men are true ; <EOV> <SOV> I am ' one ' who is testifying of myself , and the Father who sent me doth testify of me . ' <EOV> <SOV> They said , therefore , to him , ' Where is thy father ? ' Jesus answered , ' Ye have neither known me nor my Father : if me ye had known , my Father also ye had known . ' <EOV> <SOV> These sayings spake Jesus in the treasury , teaching in the temple , and no one seized him , because his hour had not yet come ; <EOV> <SOV> therefore said Jesus again to them , ' I go away , and ye will seek me , and in your sin ye shall die ; whither I go away , ye are not able to come . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , said , ' Will he kill himself , because he saith , Whither I go away , ye are not able to come ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Ye are from beneath , I am from above ; ye are of this world , I am not of this world ; <EOV> <SOV> I said , therefore , to you , that ye shall die in your sins , for if ye may not believe that I am ' he ' , ye shall die in your sins . ' <EOV> <SOV> They said , therefore , to him , ' Thou -- who art thou ? ' and Jesus said to them , ' Even what I did speak of to you at the beginning ; <EOV> <SOV> many things I have to speak concerning you and to judge , but He who sent me is true , and I -- what things I heard from Him -- these I say to the world . ' <EOV> <SOV> They knew not that of the Father he spake to them ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to them , ' When ye may lift up the Son of Man then ye will know that I am ' he ' ; and of myself I do nothing , but according as my Father did teach me , these things I speak ; <EOV> <SOV> and He who sent me is with me ; the Father did not leave me alone , because I , the things pleasing to Him , do always . ' <EOV> <SOV> As he is speaking these things , many believed in him ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said unto the Jews who believed in him , ' If ye may remain in my word , truly my disciples ye are , and ye shall know the truth , <EOV> <SOV> and the truth shall make you free . ' <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , ' Seed of Abraham we are ; and to no one have we been servants at any time ; how dost thou say -- Ye shall become free ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , ' Verily , verily , I say to you -- Every one who is committing sin , is a servant of the sin , <EOV> <SOV> and the servant doth not remain in the house -- to the age , the son doth remain -- to the age ; <EOV> <SOV> if then the son may make you free , in reality ye shall be free . <EOV> <SOV> ' I have known that ye are seed of Abraham , but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you ; <EOV> <SOV> I -- that which I have seen with my Father do speak , and ye , therefore , that which ye have seen with your father -- ye do . ' <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , ' Our father is Abraham ; ' Jesus saith to them , ' If children of Abraham ye were , the works of Abraham ye were doing ; <EOV> <SOV> and now , ye seek to kill me -- a man who hath spoken to you the truth I heard from God ; this Abraham did not ; <EOV> <SOV> ye do the works of your father . ' They said , therefore , to him , ' We of whoredom have not been born ; one Father we have -- God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus then said to them , ' If God were your father , ye were loving me , for I came forth from God , and am come ; for neither have I come of myself , but He sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> wherefore do ye not know my speech ? because ye are not able to hear my word . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye are of a father -- the devil , and the desires of your father ye will to do ; he was a man - slayer from the beginning , and in the truth he hath not stood , because there is no truth in him ; when one may speak the falsehood , of his own he speaketh , because he is a liar -- also his father . <EOV> <SOV> ' And because I say the truth , ye do not believe me . <EOV> <SOV> Who of you doth convict me of sin ? and if I speak truth , wherefore do ye not believe me ? <EOV> <SOV> he who is of God , the sayings of God he doth hear ; because of this ye do not hear , because of God ye are not . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , answered and said to him , ' Do we not say well , that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a demon ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' I have not a demon , but I honour my Father , and ye dishonour me ; <EOV> <SOV> and I do not seek my own glory ; there is who is seeking and is judging ; <EOV> <SOV> verily , verily , I say to you , If any one may keep my word , death he may not see -- to the age . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , said to him , ' Now we have known that thou hast a demon ; Abraham did die , and the prophets , and thou dost say , If any one may keep my word , he shall not taste of death -- to the age ! <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who died ? and the prophets died ; whom dost thou make thyself ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing ; it is my Father who is glorifying me , of whom ye say that He is your God ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye have not known Him , and I have known Him , and if I say that I have not known Him , I shall be like you -- speaking falsely ; but I have known Him , and His word I keep ; <EOV> <SOV> Abraham , your father , was glad that he might see my day ; and he saw , and did rejoice . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , said unto him , ' Thou art not yet fifty years old , and Abraham hast thou seen ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , ' Verily , verily , I say to you , Before Abraham 's coming -- I am ; ' <EOV> <SOV> they took up , therefore , stones that they may cast at him , but Jesus hid himself , and went forth out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And passing by , he saw a man blind from birth , <EOV> <SOV> and his disciples asked him , saying , ' Rabbi , who did sin , this one or his parents , that he should be born blind ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' Neither did this one sin nor his parents , but that the works of God may be manifested in him ; <EOV> <SOV> it behoveth me to be working the works of Him who sent me while it is day ; night doth come , when no one is able to work : -- <EOV> <SOV> when I am in the world , I am a light of the world . ' <EOV> <SOV> These things saying , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and rubbed the clay on the eyes of the blind man , and said to him , <EOV> <SOV> ' Go away , wash at the pool of Siloam , ' which is , interpreted , Sent . He went away , therefore , and did wash , and came seeing ; <EOV> <SOV> the neighbours , therefore , and those seeing him before , that he was blind , said , ' Is not this he who is sitting and begging ? ' <EOV> <SOV> others said -- ' This is he ; ' and others -- ' He is like to him ; ' he himself said , -- ' I am ' he ' . ' <EOV> <SOV> They said , therefore , to him , ' How were thine eyes opened ? ' <EOV> <SOV> he answered and said , ' A man called Jesus made clay , and rubbed my eyes , and said to me , Go away to the pool of Siloam , and wash ; and having gone away and having washed , I received sight ; ' <EOV> <SOV> they said , therefore , to him , ' Where is that one ? ' he saith , ' I have not known . ' <EOV> <SOV> They bring him to the Pharisees who once ' was ' blind , <EOV> <SOV> and it was a sabbath when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes . <EOV> <SOV> Again , therefore , the Pharisees also were asking him how he received sight , and he said to them , ' Clay he did put upon my eyes , and I did wash -- and I see . ' <EOV> <SOV> Of the Pharisees , therefore , certain said , ' This man is not from God , because the sabbath he doth not keep ; ' others said , ' How is a man -- a sinful one -- able to do such signs ? ' and there was a division among them . <EOV> <SOV> They said to the blind man again , ' Thou -- what dost thou say of him -- that he opened thine eyes ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said -- ' He is a prophet . ' The Jews , therefore , did not believe concerning him that he was blind and did receive sight , till that they called the parents of him who received sight , <EOV> <SOV> and they asked them , saying , ' Is your son , of whom ye say that he was born blind ? how then now doth he see ? ' <EOV> <SOV> His parents answered them and said , ' We have known that this is our son , and that he was born blind ; <EOV> <SOV> and how he now seeth , we have not known ; or who opened his eyes , we have not known ; himself is of age , ask him ; he himself shall speak concerning himself . ' <EOV> <SOV> These things said his parents , because they were afraid of the Jews , for already had the Jews agreed together , that if any one may confess him -- Christ , he may be put out of the synagogue ; <EOV> <SOV> because of this his parents said -- ' He is of age , ask him . ' <EOV> <SOV> They called , therefore , a second time the man who was blind , and they said to him , ' Give glory to God , we have known that this man is a sinner ; ' <EOV> <SOV> he answered , therefore , and said , ' If he be a sinner -- I have not known , one thing I have known , that , being blind , now I see . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him again , ' What did he to thee ? how did he open thine eyes ? ' <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , ' I told you already , and ye did not hear ; why again do ye wish to hear ? do ye also wish to become his disciples ? ' <EOV> <SOV> They reviled him , therefore , and said , ' Thou art his disciple , and we are Moses ' disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> we have known that God hath spoken to Moses , but this one -- we have not known whence he is . ' <EOV> <SOV> The man answered and said to them , ' Why , in this is a wonderful thing , that ye have not known whence he is , and he opened my eyes ! <EOV> <SOV> and we have known that God doth not hear sinners , but , if any one may be a worshipper of God , and may do His will , him He doth hear ; <EOV> <SOV> from the age it was not heard , that any one did open eyes of one who hath been born blind ; <EOV> <SOV> if this one were not from God , he were not able to do anything . ' <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said to him , ' In sins thou wast born altogether , and thou dost teach us ! ' and they cast him forth without . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus heard that they cast him forth without , and having found him , he said to him , ' Dost thou believe in the Son of God ? ' <EOV> <SOV> he answered and said , ' Who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , ' Thou hast both seen him , and he who is speaking with thee is he ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' I believe , sir , ' and bowed before him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' For judgment I to this world did come , that those not seeing may see , and those seeing may become blind . ' <EOV> <SOV> And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and they said to him , ' Are we also blind ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to them , ' If ye were blind , ye were not having had sin , but now ye say -- We see , therefore doth your sin remain . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' Verily , verily , I say to you , He who is not entering through the door to the fold of the sheep , but is going up from another side , that one is a thief and a robber ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep ; <EOV> <SOV> to this one the doorkeeper doth open , and the sheep hear his voice , and his own sheep he doth call by name , and doth lead them forth ; <EOV> <SOV> and when his own sheep he may put forth , before them he goeth on , and the sheep follow him , because they have known his voice ; <EOV> <SOV> and a stranger they will not follow , but will flee from him , because they have not known the voice of strangers . ' <EOV> <SOV> This similitude spake Jesus to them , and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said therefore again to them , ' Verily , verily , I say to you -- I am the door of the sheep ; <EOV> <SOV> all , as many as came before me , are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not hear them ; <EOV> <SOV> I am the door , through me if any one may come in , he shall be saved , and he shall come in , and go out , and find pasture . <EOV> <SOV> ' The thief doth not come , except that he may steal , and kill , and destroy ; I came that they may have life , and may have ' it ' abundantly . <EOV> <SOV> ' I am the good shepherd ; the good shepherd his life layeth down for the sheep ; <EOV> <SOV> and the hireling , and not being a shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , doth behold the wolf coming , and doth leave the sheep , and doth flee ; and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep ; <EOV> <SOV> and the hireling doth flee because he is an hireling , and is not caring for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> ' I am the good shepherd , and I know my ' sheep ' , and am known by mine , <EOV> <SOV> according as the Father doth know me , and I know the Father , and my life I lay down for the sheep , <EOV> <SOV> and other sheep I have that are not of this fold , these also it behoveth me to bring , and my voice they will hear , and there shall become one flock -- one shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> ' Because of this doth the Father love me , because I lay down my life , that again I may take it ; <EOV> <SOV> no one doth take it from me , but I lay it down of myself ; authority I have to lay it down , and authority I have again to take it ; this command I received from my Father . ' <EOV> <SOV> Therefore , again , there came a division among the Jews , because of these words , <EOV> <SOV> and many of them said , ' He hath a demon , and is mad , why do ye hear him ? ' <EOV> <SOV> others said , ' These sayings are not those of a demoniac ; is a demon able blind men 's eyes to open ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And the dedication in Jerusalem came , and it was winter , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus was walking in the temple , in the porch of Solomon , <EOV> <SOV> the Jews , therefore , came round about him , and said to him , ' Till when our soul dost thou hold in suspense ? if thou art the Christ , tell us freely . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , ' I told you , and ye do not believe ; the works that I do in the name of my Father , these testify concerning me ; <EOV> <SOV> but ye do not believe , for ye are not of my sheep , <EOV> <SOV> according as I said to you : My sheep my voice do hear , and I know them , and they follow me , <EOV> <SOV> and life age - during I give to them , and they shall not perish -- to the age , and no one shall pluck them out of my hand ; <EOV> <SOV> my Father , who hath given to me , is greater than all , and no one is able to pluck out of the hand of my Father ; <EOV> <SOV> I and the Father are one . ' <EOV> <SOV> Therefore , again , did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , ' Many good works did I shew you from my Father ; because of which work of them do ye stone me ? ' <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , saying , ' For a good work we do not stone thee , but for evil speaking , and because thou , being a man , dost make thyself God . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , ' Is it not having been written in your law : I said , ye are gods ? <EOV> <SOV> if them he did call gods unto whom the word of God came , ( and the Writing is not able to be broken , ) <EOV> <SOV> of him whom the Father did sanctify , and send to the world , do ye say -- Thou speakest evil , because I said , Son of God I am ? <EOV> <SOV> if I do not the works of my Father , do not believe me ; <EOV> <SOV> and if I do , even if me ye may not believe , the works believe , that ye may know and may believe that in me ' is ' the Father , and I in Him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Therefore were they seeking again to seize him , and he went forth out of their hand , <EOV> <SOV> and went away again to the other side of the Jordan , to the place where John was at first baptizing , and remained there , <EOV> <SOV> and many came unto him , and said -- ' John , indeed , did no sign , and all things , as many as John said about this one were true ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and many did believe in him there . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And there was a certain one ailing , Lazarus , from Bethany , of the village of Mary and Martha her sister -- <EOV> <SOV> and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment , and did wipe his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was ailing -- <EOV> <SOV> therefore sent the sisters unto him , saying , ' Sir , lo , he whom thou dost love is ailing ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having heard , said , ' This ailment is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified through it . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus was loving Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus , <EOV> <SOV> when , therefore , he heard that he is ailing , then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days , <EOV> <SOV> then after this , he saith to the disciples , ' We may go to Judea again ; ' <EOV> <SOV> the disciples say to him , ' Rabbi , now were the Jews seeking to stone thee , and again thou dost go thither ! ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' Are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any one may walk in the day , he doth not stumble , because the light of this world he doth see ; <EOV> <SOV> and if any one may walk in the night , he stumbleth , because the light is not in him . ' <EOV> <SOV> These things he said , and after this he saith to them , ' Lazarus our friend hath fallen asleep , but I go on that I may awake him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> therefore said his disciples , ' Sir , if he hath fallen asleep , he will be saved ; ' <EOV> <SOV> but Jesus had spoken about his death , but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> Then , therefore , Jesus said to them freely , ' Lazarus hath died ; <EOV> <SOV> and I rejoice , for your sake , ( that ye may believe , ) that I was not there ; but we may go to him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> therefore said Thomas , who is called Didymus , to the fellow - disciples , ' We may go -- we also , that we may die with him , ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , having come , found him having been four days already in the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off , <EOV> <SOV> and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary , that they might comfort them concerning their brother ; <EOV> <SOV> Martha , therefore , when she heard that Jesus doth come , met him , and Mary kept sitting in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Martha , therefore , said unto Jesus , ' Sir , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died ; <EOV> <SOV> but even now , I have known that whatever thou mayest ask of God , God will give to thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' Thy brother shall rise again . ' <EOV> <SOV> Martha saith to him , ' I have known that he will rise again , in the rising again in the last day ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to her , ' I am the rising again , and the life ; he who is believing in me , even if he may die , shall live ; <EOV> <SOV> and every one who is living and believing in me shall not die -- to the age ; <EOV> <SOV> believest thou this ? ' she saith to him , ' Yes , sir , I have believed that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , who is coming to the world . ' <EOV> <SOV> And these things having said , she went away , and called Mary her sister privately , saying , ' The Teacher is present , and doth call thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> she , when she heard , riseth up quickly , and doth come to him ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus had not yet come to the village , but was in the place where Martha met him ; <EOV> <SOV> the Jews , therefore , who were with her in the house , and were comforting her , having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth , followed her , saying -- ' She doth go away to the tomb , that she may weep there . ' <EOV> <SOV> Mary , therefore , when she came where Jesus was , having seen him , fell at his feet , saying to him , ' Sir , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , when he saw her weeping , and the Jews who came with her weeping , did groan in the spirit , and troubled himself , and he said , <EOV> <SOV> ' Where have ye laid him ? ' they say to him , ' Sir , come and see ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus wept . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , said , ' Lo , how he was loving him ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and certain of them said , ' Was not this one , who did open the eyes of the blind man , able to cause that also this one might not have died ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , again groaning in himself , cometh to the tomb , and it was a cave , and a stone was lying upon it , <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith , ' Take ye away the stone ; ' the sister of him who hath died -- Martha -- saith to him , ' Sir , already he stinketh , for he is four days dead ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' Said I not to thee , that if thou mayest believe , thou shalt see the glory of God ? ' <EOV> <SOV> They took away , therefore , the stone where the dead was laid , and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards , and said , ' Father , I thank Thee , that Thou didst hear me ; <EOV> <SOV> and I knew that Thou always dost hear me , but , because of the multitude that is standing by , I said ' it ' , that they may believe that Thou didst send me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And these things saying , with a loud voice he cried out , ' Lazarus , come forth ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he who died came forth , being bound feet and hands with grave - clothes , and his visage with a napkin was bound about ; Jesus saith to them , ' Loose him , and suffer to go . ' <EOV> <SOV> Many , therefore , of the Jews who came unto Mary , and beheld what Jesus did , believed in him ; <EOV> <SOV> but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees , and told them what Jesus did ; <EOV> <SOV> the chief priests , therefore , and the Pharisees , gathered together a sanhedrim , and said , ' What may we do ? because this man doth many signs ? <EOV> <SOV> if we may let him alone thus , all will believe in him ; and the Romans will come , and will take away both our place and nation . ' <EOV> <SOV> and a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being chief priest of that year , said to them , ' Ye have not known anything , <EOV> <SOV> nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people , and not the whole nation perish . ' <EOV> <SOV> And this he said not of himself , but being chief priest of that year , he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation , <EOV> <SOV> and not for the nation only , but that also the children of God , who have been scattered abroad , he may gather together into one . <EOV> <SOV> From that day , therefore , they took counsel together that they may kill him ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , was no more freely walking among the Jews , but went away thence to the region nigh the wilderness , to a city called Ephraim , and there he tarried with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the passover of the Jews was nigh , and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover , that they might purify themselves ; <EOV> <SOV> they were seeking , therefore , Jesus , and said one with another , standing in the temple , ' What doth appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command , that if any one may know where he is , he may shew ' it ' , so that they may seize him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , six days before the passover , came to Bethany , where was Lazarus , who had died , whom he raised out of the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> they made , therefore , to him a supper there , and Martha was ministering , and Lazarus was one of those reclining together ( at meat ) with him ; <EOV> <SOV> Mary , therefore , having taken a pound of ointment of spikenard , of great price , anointed the feet of Jesus and did wipe with her hair his feet , and the house was filled from the fragrance of the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore saith one of his disciples -- Judas Iscariot , of Simon , who is about to deliver him up -- <EOV> <SOV> ' Wherefore was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries , and given to the poor ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said this , not because he was caring for the poor , but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and what things were put in he was carrying . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said , ' Suffer her ; for the day of my embalming she hath kept it , <EOV> <SOV> for the poor ye have always with yourselves , and me ye have not always . ' <EOV> <SOV> A great multitude , therefore , of the Jews knew that he is there , and they came , not because of Jesus only , but that Lazarus also they may see , whom he raised out of the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> and the chief priests took counsel , that also Lazarus they may kill , <EOV> <SOV> because on account of him many of the Jews were going away , and were believing in Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow , a great multitude that came to the feast , having heard that Jesus doth come to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> took the branches of the palms , and went forth to meet him , and were crying , ' Hosanna , blessed ' is ' he who is coming in the name of the Lord -- the king of Israel ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having found a young ass did sit upon it , according as it is written , <EOV> <SOV> ' Fear not , daughter of Sion , lo , thy king doth come , sitting on an ass ' colt . ' <EOV> <SOV> And these things his disciples did not know at the first , but when Jesus was glorified , then they remembered that these things were having been written about him , and these things they did to him . <EOV> <SOV> The multitude , therefore , who are with him , were testifying that he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and did raise him out of the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> because of this also did the multitude meet him , because they heard of his having done this sign , <EOV> <SOV> the Pharisees , therefore , said among themselves , ' Ye see that ye do not gain anything , lo , the world did go after him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there were certain Greeks out of those coming up that they may worship in the feast , <EOV> <SOV> these then came near to Philip , who ' is ' from Bethsaida of Galilee , and were asking him , saying , ' Sir , we wish to see Jesus ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew , and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus responded to them , saying , ' The hour hath come that the Son of Man may be glorified ; <EOV> <SOV> verily , verily , I say to you , if the grain of the wheat , having fallen to the earth , may not die , itself remaineth alone ; and if it may die , it doth bear much fruit ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is loving his life shall lose it , and he who is hating his life in this world -- to life age - during shall keep it ; <EOV> <SOV> if any one may minister to me , let him follow me , and where I am , there also my ministrant shall be ; and if any one may minister to me -- honour him will the Father . <EOV> <SOV> ' Now hath my soul been troubled , and what ? shall I say -- Father , save me from this hour ? -- but because of this I came to this hour ; <EOV> <SOV> Father , glorify Thy name . ' There came , therefore , a voice out of the heaven , ' I both glorified , and again I will glorify ' it ' ; ' <EOV> <SOV> the multitude , therefore , having stood and heard , were saying that there hath been thunder ; others said , ' A messenger hath spoken to him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said , ' Not because of me hath this voice come , but because of you ; <EOV> <SOV> now is a judgment of this world , now shall the ruler of this world be cast forth ; <EOV> <SOV> and I , if I may be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto myself . ' <EOV> <SOV> And this he said signifying by what death he was about to die ; <EOV> <SOV> the multitude answered him , ' We heard out of the law that the Christ doth remain -- to the age ; and how dost thou say , That it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up ? who is this -- the Son of Man ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to them , ' Yet a little time is the light with you ; walk while ye have the light , that darkness may not overtake you ; and he who is walking in the darkness hath not known where he goeth ; <EOV> <SOV> while ye have the light , believe in the light , that sons of light ye may become . ' These things spake Jesus , and having gone away , he was hid from them , <EOV> <SOV> yet he having done so many signs before them , they were not believing in him , <EOV> <SOV> that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he said , ' Lord , who gave credence to our report ? and the arm of the Lord -- to whom was it revealed ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Because of this they were not able to believe , that again Isaiah said , <EOV> <SOV> ' He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart , that they might not see with the eyes , and understand with the heart , and turn back , and I might heal them ; ' <EOV> <SOV> these things said Isaiah , when he saw his glory , and spake of him . <EOV> <SOV> Still , however , also out of the rulers did many believe in him , but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing , that they might not be put out of the synagogue , <EOV> <SOV> for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus cried and said , ' He who is believing in me , doth not believe in me , but in Him who sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who is beholding me , doth behold Him who sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> I a light to the world have come , that every one who is believing in me -- in the darkness may not remain ; <EOV> <SOV> and if any one may hear my sayings , and not believe , I -- I do not judge him , for I came not that I might judge the world , but that I might save the world . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is rejecting me , and not receiving my sayings , hath one who is judging him , the word that I spake , that will judge him in the last day , <EOV> <SOV> because I spake not from myself , but the Father who sent me , He did give me a command , what I may say , and what I may speak , <EOV> <SOV> and I have known that His command is life age - during ; what , therefore , I speak , according as the Father hath said to me , so I speak . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And before the feast of the passover , Jesus knowing that his hour hath come , that he may remove out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own who ' are ' in the world -- to the end he loved them . <EOV> <SOV> And supper being come , the devil already having put ' it ' into the heart of Judas of Simon , Iscariot , that he may deliver him up , <EOV> <SOV> Jesus knowing that all things the Father hath given to him -- into ' his ' hands , and that from God he came forth , and unto God he goeth , <EOV> <SOV> doth rise from the supper , and doth lay down his garments , and having taken a towel , he girded himself ; <EOV> <SOV> afterward he putteth water into the basin , and began to wash the feet of his disciples , and to wipe with the towel with which he was being girded . <EOV> <SOV> He cometh , therefore , unto Simon Peter , and that one saith to him , ' Sir , thou -- dost thou wash my feet ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , ' That which I do thou hast not known now , but thou shalt know after these things ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith to him , ' Thou mayest not wash my feet -- to the age . ' Jesus answered him , ' If I may not wash thee , thou hast no part with me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith to him , ' Sir , not my feet only , but also the hands and the head . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' He who hath been bathed hath no need save to wash his feet , but he is clean altogether ; and ye are clean , but not all ; ' <EOV> <SOV> for he knew him who is delivering him up ; because of this he said , ' Ye are not all clean . ' <EOV> <SOV> When , therefore , he washed their feet , and took his garments , having reclined ( at meat ) again , he said to them , ' Do ye know what I have done to you ? <EOV> <SOV> ye call me , The Teacher and The Lord , and ye say well , for I am ; <EOV> <SOV> if then I did wash your feet -- the Lord and the Teacher -- ye also ought to wash one another 's feet . <EOV> <SOV> ' For an example I gave to you , that , according as I did to you , ye also may do ; <EOV> <SOV> verily , verily , I say to you , a servant is not greater than his lord , nor an apostle greater than he who sent him ; <EOV> <SOV> if these things ye have known , happy are ye , if ye may do them ; <EOV> <SOV> not concerning you all do I speak ; I have known whom I chose for myself ; but that the Writing may be fulfilled : He who is eating the bread with me , did lift up against me his heel . <EOV> <SOV> ' From this time I tell you , before its coming to pass , that , when it may come to pass , ye may believe that I am ' he ' ; <EOV> <SOV> verily , verily , I say to you , he who is receiving whomsoever I may send , doth receive me ; and he who is receiving me , doth receive Him who sent me . ' <EOV> <SOV> These things having said , Jesus was troubled in the spirit , and did testify , and said , ' Verily , verily , I say to you , that one of you will deliver me up ; ' <EOV> <SOV> the disciples were looking , therefore , one at another , doubting concerning whom he speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> And there was one of his disciples reclining ( at meat ) in the bosom of Jesus , whom Jesus was loving ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter , then , doth beckon to this one , to inquire who he may be concerning whom he speaketh , <EOV> <SOV> and that one having leant back on the breast of Jesus , respondeth to him , ' Sir , who is it ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answereth , ' That one it is to whom I , having dipped the morsel , shall give it ; ' and having dipped the morsel , he giveth ' it ' to Judas of Simon , Iscariot . <EOV> <SOV> And after the morsel , then the Adversary entered into that one , Jesus , therefore , saith to him , ' What thou dost -- do quickly ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and none of those reclining at meat knew for what intent he said this to him , <EOV> <SOV> for certain were thinking , since Judas had the bag , that Jesus saith to him , ' Buy what we have need of for the feast ; ' or that he may give something to the poor ; <EOV> <SOV> having received , therefore , the morsel , that one immediately went forth , and it was night . <EOV> <SOV> When , therefore , he went forth , Jesus saith , ' Now was the Son of Man glorified , and God was glorified in him ; <EOV> <SOV> if God was glorified in him , God also will glorify him in Himself ; yea , immediately He will glorify him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Little children , yet a little am I with you ; ye will seek me , and , according as I said to the Jews -- Whither I go away , ye are not able to come , to you also I do say ' it ' now . <EOV> <SOV> ' A new commandment I give to you , that ye love one another ; according as I did love you , that ye also love one another ; <EOV> <SOV> in this shall all know that ye are my disciples , if ye may have love one to another . ' <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith to him , ' Sir , whither dost thou go away ? ' Jesus answered him , ' Whither I go away , thou art not able now to follow me , but afterward thou shalt follow me . ' <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith to him , ' Sir , wherefore am I not able to follow thee now ? my life for thee I will lay down ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , ' Thy life for me thou wilt lay down ! verily , verily , I say to thee , a cock will not crow till thou mayest deny me thrice . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' Let not your heart be troubled , believe in God , also in me believe ; <EOV> <SOV> in the house of my Father are many mansions ; and if not , I would have told you ; I go on to prepare a place for you ; <EOV> <SOV> and if I go on and prepare for you a place , again do I come , and will receive you unto myself , that where I am ye also may be ; <EOV> <SOV> and whither I go away ye have known , and the way ye have known . ' <EOV> <SOV> Thomas saith to him , ' Sir , we have not known whither thou goest away , and how are we able to know the way ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' I am the way , and the truth , and the life , no one doth come unto the Father , if not through me ; <EOV> <SOV> if ye had known me , my Father also ye would have known , and from this time ye have known Him , and have seen Him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Philip saith to him , ' Sir , shew to us the Father , and it is enough for us ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' So long time am I with you , and thou hast not known me , Philip ? he who hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how dost thou say , Shew to us the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> Believest thou not that I ' am ' in the Father , and the Father is in me ? the sayings that I speak to you , from myself I speak not , and the Father who is abiding in me , Himself doth the works ; <EOV> <SOV> believe me , that I ' am ' in the Father , and the Father in me ; and if not , because of the works themselves , believe me . <EOV> <SOV> ' Verily , verily , I say to you , he who is believing in me , the works that I do -- that one also shall do , and greater than these he shall do , because I go on to my Father ; <EOV> <SOV> and whatever ye may ask in my name , I will do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son ; <EOV> <SOV> if ye ask anything in my name I will do ' it ' . <EOV> <SOV> ' If ye love me , my commands keep , <EOV> <SOV> and I will ask the Father , and another Comforter He will give to you , that he may remain with you -- to the age ; <EOV> <SOV> the Spirit of truth , whom the world is not able to receive , because it doth not behold him , nor know him , and ye know him , because he doth remain with you , and shall be in you . <EOV> <SOV> ' I will not leave you bereaved , I come unto you ; <EOV> <SOV> yet a little , and the world doth no more behold me , and ye behold me , because I live , and ye shall live ; <EOV> <SOV> in that day ye shall know that I ' am ' in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is having my commands , and is keeping them , that one it is who is loving me , and he who is loving me shall be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Judas saith to him , ( not the Iscariot ) , ' Sir , what hath come to pass , that to us thou are about to manifest thyself , and not to the world ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to him , ' If any one may love me , my word he will keep , and my Father will love him , and unto him we will come , and abode with him we will make ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is not loving me , my words doth not keep ; and the word that ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's who sent me . <EOV> <SOV> ' These things I have spoken to you , remaining with you , <EOV> <SOV> and the Comforter , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and remind you of all things that I said to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' Peace I leave to you ; my peace I give to you , not according as the world doth give do I give to you ; let not your heart be troubled , nor let it be afraid ; <EOV> <SOV> ye heard that I said to you -- I go away , and I come unto you ; if ye did love me , ye would have rejoiced that I said -- I go on to the Father , because my Father is greater than I. <EOV> <SOV> ' And now I have said ' it ' to you before it come to pass , that when it may come to pass , ye may believe ; <EOV> <SOV> I will no more talk much with you , for the ruler of this world doth come , and in me he hath nothing ; <EOV> <SOV> but that the world may know that I love the Father , and according as the Father gave me command so I do ; arise , we may go hence . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman ; <EOV> <SOV> every branch in me not bearing fruit , He doth take it away , and every one bearing fruit , He doth cleanse by pruning it , that it may bear more fruit ; <EOV> <SOV> already ye are clean , because of the word that I have spoken to you ; <EOV> <SOV> remain in me , and I in you , as the branch is not able to bear fruit of itself , if it may not remain in the vine , so neither ye , if ye may not remain in me . <EOV> <SOV> ' I am the vine , ye the branches ; he who is remaining in me , and I in him , this one doth bear much fruit , because apart from me ye are not able to do anything ; <EOV> <SOV> if any one may not remain in me , he was cast forth without as the branch , and was withered , and they gather them , and cast to fire , and they are burned ; <EOV> <SOV> if ye may remain in me , and my sayings in you may remain , whatever ye may wish ye shall ask , and it shall be done to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' In this was my Father glorified , that ye may bear much fruit , and ye shall become my disciples . <EOV> <SOV> According as the Father did love me , I also loved you , remain in my love ; <EOV> <SOV> if my commandments ye may keep , ye shall remain in my love , according as I the commands of my Father have kept , and do remain in His love ; <EOV> <SOV> these things I have spoken to you , that my joy in you may remain , and your joy may be full . <EOV> <SOV> ' This is my command , that ye love one another , according as I did love you ; <EOV> <SOV> greater love than this hath no one , that any one his life may lay down for his friends ; <EOV> <SOV> ye are my friends , if ye may do whatever I command you ; <EOV> <SOV> no more do I call you servants , because the servant hath not known what his lord doth , and you I have called friends , because all things that I heard from my Father , I did make known to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye did not choose out me , but I chose out you , and did appoint you , that ye might go away , and might bear fruit , and your fruit might remain , that whatever ye may ask of the Father in my name , He may give you . <EOV> <SOV> ' These things I command you , that ye love one another ; <EOV> <SOV> if the world doth hate you , ye know that it hath hated me before you ; <EOV> <SOV> if of the world ye were , the world its own would have been loving , and because of the world ye are not -- but I chose out of the world -- because of this the world hateth you . <EOV> <SOV> ' Remember the word that I said to you , A servant is not greater than his lord ; if me they did persecute , you also they will persecute ; if my word they did keep , yours also they will keep ; <EOV> <SOV> but all these things will they do to you , because of my name , because they have not known Him who sent me ; <EOV> <SOV> if I had not come and spoken to them , they were not having sin ; but now pretext they have not for their sin . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is hating me , doth hate also my Father ; <EOV> <SOV> if I did not do among them the works that no other hath done , they were not having sin , and now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father ; <EOV> <SOV> but -- that the word may be fulfilled that was written in their law -- They hated me without a cause . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when the Comforter may come , whom I will send to you from the Father -- the Spirit of truth , who from the Father doth come forth , he will testify of me ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye also do testify , because from the beginning ye are with me . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' These things I have spoken to you , that ye may not be stumbled , <EOV> <SOV> out of the synagogues they will put you ; but an hour doth come , that every one who hath killed you , may think to offer service unto God ; <EOV> <SOV> and these things they will do to you , because they did not know the Father , nor me . <EOV> <SOV> ' But these things I have spoken to you , that when the hour may come , ye may remember them , that I said ' them ' to you , and these things to you from the beginning I did not say , because I was with you ; <EOV> <SOV> and now I go away to Him who sent me , and none of you doth ask me , Whither dost thou go ? <EOV> <SOV> but because these things I have said to you , the sorrow hath filled your heart . <EOV> <SOV> ' But I tell you the truth ; it is better for you that I go away , for if I may not go away , the Comforter will not come unto you , and if I go on , I will send Him unto you ; <EOV> <SOV> and having come , He will convict the world concerning sin , and concerning righteousness , and concerning judgment ; <EOV> <SOV> concerning sin indeed , because they do not believe in me ; <EOV> <SOV> and concerning righteousness , because unto my Father I go away , and no more do ye behold me ; <EOV> <SOV> and concerning judgment , because the ruler of this world hath been judged . <EOV> <SOV> ' I have yet many things to say to you , but ye are not able to bear ' them ' now ; <EOV> <SOV> and when He may come -- the Spirit of truth -- He will guide you to all the truth , for He will not speak from Himself , but as many things as He will hear He will speak , and the coming things He will tell you ; <EOV> <SOV> He will glorify me , because of mine He will take , and will tell to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' All things , as many as the Father hath , are mine ; because of this I said , That of mine He will take , and will tell to you ; <EOV> <SOV> a little while , and ye do not behold me , and again a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go away unto the Father . ' <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said ' some ' of his disciples one to another , ' What is this that he saith to us , A little while , and ye do not behold me , and again a little while , and ye shall see me , and , Because I go away unto the Father ? ' <EOV> <SOV> they said then , ' What is this he saith -- the little while ? we have not known what he saith . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , knew that they were wishing to ask him , and he said to them , ' Concerning this do ye seek one with another , because I said , A little while , and you do not behold me , and again a little while , and ye shall see me ? <EOV> <SOV> verily , verily , I say to you , that ye shall weep and lament , and the world will rejoice ; and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow joy will become . <EOV> <SOV> ' The woman , when she may bear , hath sorrow , because her hour did come , and when she may bear the child , no more doth she remember the anguish , because of the joy that a man was born to the world . <EOV> <SOV> ' And ye , therefore , now , indeed , have sorrow ; and again I will see you , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one doth take from you , <EOV> <SOV> and in that day ye will question me nothing ; verily , verily , I say to you , as many things as ye may ask of the Father in my name , He will give you ; <EOV> <SOV> till now ye did ask nothing in my name ; ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full . <EOV> <SOV> ' These things in similitudes I have spoken to you , but there cometh an hour when no more in similitudes will I speak to you , but freely of the Father , will tell you . <EOV> <SOV> ' In that day , in my name ye will make request , and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father for you , <EOV> <SOV> for the Father himself doth love you , because me ye have loved , and ye have believed that I from God came forth ; <EOV> <SOV> I came forth from the Father , and have come to the world ; again I leave the world , and go on unto the Father . ' <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say to him , ' Lo , now freely thou dost speak , and no similitude speakest thou ; <EOV> <SOV> now we have known that thou hast known all things , and hast no need that any one do question thee ; in this we believe that from God thou didst come forth . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , ' Now do ye believe ? lo , there doth come an hour , <EOV> <SOV> and now it hath come , that ye may be scattered , each to his own things , and me ye may leave alone , and I am not alone , because the Father is with me ; <EOV> <SOV> these things I have spoken to you , that in me ye may have peace , in the world ye shall have tribulation , but take courage -- I have overcome the world . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things spake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to the heaven , and said -- ' Father , the hour hath come , glorify Thy Son , that Thy Son also may glorify Thee , <EOV> <SOV> according as Thou didst give to him authority over all flesh , that -- all that Thou hast given to him -- he may give to them life age - during ; <EOV> <SOV> and this is the life age - during , that they may know Thee , the only true God , and him whom Thou didst send -- Jesus Christ ; <EOV> <SOV> I did glorify Thee on the earth , the work I did finish that Thou hast given me , that I may do ' it ' . <EOV> <SOV> ' And now , glorify me , Thou Father , with Thyself , with the glory that I had before the world was , with Thee ; <EOV> <SOV> I did manifest Thy name to the men whom Thou hast given to me out of the world ; Thine they were , and to me Thou hast given them , and Thy word they have kept ; <EOV> <SOV> now they have known that all things , as many as Thou hast given to me , are from Thee , <EOV> <SOV> because the sayings that Thou hast given to me , I have given to them , and they themselves received , and have known truly , that from Thee I came forth , and they did believe that Thou didst send me . <EOV> <SOV> ' I ask in regard to them ; not in regard to the world do I ask , but in regard to those whom Thou hast given to me , because Thine they are , <EOV> <SOV> and all mine are Thine , and Thine ' are ' mine , and I have been glorified in them ; <EOV> <SOV> and no more am I in the world , and these are in the world , and I come unto Thee . Holy Father , keep them in Thy name , whom Thou hast given to me , that they may be one as we ; <EOV> <SOV> when I was with them in the world , I was keeping them in Thy name ; those whom Thou hast given to me I did guard , and none of them was destroyed , except the son of the destruction , that the Writing may be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> ' And now unto Thee I come , and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves ; <EOV> <SOV> I have given to them Thy word , and the world did hate them , because they are not of the world , as I am not of the world ; <EOV> <SOV> I do not ask that Thou mayest take them out of the world , but that Thou mayest keep them out of the evil . <EOV> <SOV> ' Of the world they are not , as I of the world am not ; <EOV> <SOV> sanctify them in Thy truth , Thy word is truth ; <EOV> <SOV> as Thou didst send me to the world , I also did send them to the world ; <EOV> <SOV> and for them do I sanctify myself , that they also themselves may be sanctified in truth . <EOV> <SOV> ' And not in regard to these alone do I ask , but also in regard to those who shall be believing , through their word , in me ; <EOV> <SOV> that they all may be one , as Thou Father ' art ' in me , and I in Thee ; that they also in us may be one , that the world may believe that Thou didst send me . <EOV> <SOV> ' And I , the glory that thou hast given to me , have given to them , that they may be one as we are one ; <EOV> <SOV> I in them , and Thou in me , that they may be perfected into one , and that the world may know that Thou didst send me , and didst love them as Thou didst love me . <EOV> <SOV> ' Father , those whom Thou hast given to me , I will that where I am they also may be with me , that they may behold my glory that Thou didst give to me , because Thou didst love me before the foundation of the world . <EOV> <SOV> ' Righteous Father , also the world did not know Thee , and I knew Thee , and these have known that Thou didst send me , <EOV> <SOV> and I made known to them Thy name , and will make known , that the love with which Thou lovedst me in them may be , and I in them . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things having said , Jesus went forth with his disciples beyond the brook of Kedron , where was a garden , into which he entered , himself and his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and Judas also , who delivered him up , had known the place , because many times did Jesus assemble there with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Judas , therefore , having taken the band and officers out of the chief priests and Pharisees , doth come thither with torches and lamps , and weapons ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , knowing all things that are coming upon him , having gone forth , said to them , ' Whom do ye seek ? ' <EOV> <SOV> they answered him , ' Jesus the Nazarene ; ' Jesus saith to them , ' I am ' he ' ; ' -- and Judas who delivered him up was standing with them ; -- <EOV> <SOV> when , therefore , he said to them -- ' I am ' he ' , ' they went away backward , and fell to the ground . <EOV> <SOV> Again , therefore , he questioned them , ' Whom do ye seek ? ' and they said , ' Jesus the Nazarene ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' I said to you that I am ' he ' ; if , then , me ye seek , suffer these to go away ; ' <EOV> <SOV> that the word might be fulfilled that he said -- ' Those whom Thou hast given to me , I did not lose of them even one . ' <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter , therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the chief priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear -- and the name of the servant was Malchus -- <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to Peter , ' Put the sword into the sheath ; the cup that the Father hath given to me , may I not drink it ? ' <EOV> <SOV> The band , therefore , and the captain , and the officers of the Jews , took hold on Jesus , and bound him , <EOV> <SOV> and they led him away to Annas first , for he was father - in - law of Caiaphas , who was chief priest of that year , <EOV> <SOV> and Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews , that it is good for one man to perish for the people . <EOV> <SOV> And following Jesus was Simon Peter , and the other disciple , and that disciple was known to the chief priest , and he entered with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest , <EOV> <SOV> and Peter was standing at the door without , therefore went forth the other disciple who was known to the chief priest , and he spake to the female keeping the door , and he brought in Peter . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the maid keeping the door to Peter , ' Art thou also of the disciples of this man ? ' he saith , ' I am not ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and the servants and the officers were standing , having made a fire of coals , because it was cold , and they were warming themselves , and Peter was standing with them , and warming himself . <EOV> <SOV> The chief priests , therefore , questioned Jesus concerning his disciples , and concerning his teaching ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , ' I spake freely to the world , I did always teach in a synagogue , and in the temple , where the Jews do always come together ; and in secret I spake nothing ; <EOV> <SOV> why me dost thou question ? question those having heard what I spake to them ; lo , these have known what I said . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he having said these things , one of the officers standing by did give Jesus a slap , saying , ' Thus dost thou answer the chief priest ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , ' If I spake ill , testify concerning the ill ; and if well , why me dost thou smite ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself , they said then to him , ' Art thou also of his disciples ? ' he denied , and said , ' I am not . ' <EOV> <SOV> One of the servants of the chief priest , being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off , saith , ' Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? ' <EOV> <SOV> again , therefore , Peter denied , and immediately a cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> They led , therefore , Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium , and it was early , and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but that they might eat the passover ; <EOV> <SOV> Pilate , therefore , went forth unto them , and said , ' What accusation do ye bring against this man ? ' <EOV> <SOV> they answered and said to him , ' If he were not an evil doer , we had not delivered him to thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> Pilate , therefore , said to them , ' Take ye him -- ye -- and according to your law judge him ; ' the Jews , therefore , said to him , ' It is not lawful to us to put any one to death ; ' <EOV> <SOV> that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said , signifying by what death he was about to die . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate , therefore , entered into the praetorium again , and called Jesus , and said to him , ' Thou art the King of the Jews ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , ' From thyself dost thou say this ? or did others say it to thee about me ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , ' Am I a Jew ? thy nation , and the chief priests did deliver thee up to me ; what didst thou ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' My kingdom is not of this world ; if my kingdom were of this world , my officers had struggled that I might not be delivered up to Jews ; but now my kingdom is not from hence . ' <EOV> <SOV> Pilate , therefore , said to him , ' Art thou then a king ? ' Jesus answered , ' Thou dost say ' it ' ; because a king I am , I for this have been born , and for this I have come to the world , that I may testify to the truth ; every one who is of the truth , doth hear my voice . ' <EOV> <SOV> Pilate saith to him , ' What is truth ? ' and this having said , again he went forth unto the Jews , and saith to them , ' I do find no fault in him ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover ; will ye , therefore , ' that ' I shall release to you the king of the Jews ? ' <EOV> <SOV> therefore they all cried out again , saying , ' Not this one -- but Barabbas ; ' and Barabbas was a robber . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then , therefore , did Pilate take Jesus and scourge ' him ' , <EOV> <SOV> and the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns , did place ' it ' on his head , and a purple garment they put around him , <EOV> <SOV> and said , ' Hail ! the king of the Jews ; ' and they were giving him slaps . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate , therefore , again went forth without , and saith to them , ' Lo , I do bring him to you without , that ye may know that in him I find no fault ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , came forth without , bearing the thorny crown and the purple garment ; and he saith to them , ' Lo , the man ! ' <EOV> <SOV> When , therefore , the chief priests and the officers did see him , they cried out , saying , ' Crucify , crucify ; ' Pilate saith to them , ' Take ye him -- ye , and crucify ; for I find no fault in him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> the Jews answered him , ' We have a law , and according to our law he ought to die , for he made himself Son of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> When , therefore , Pilate heard this word , he was the more afraid , <EOV> <SOV> and entered again to the praetorium , and saith to Jesus , ' Whence art thou ? ' and Jesus gave him no answer . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate , therefore , saith to him , ' To me dost thou not speak ? hast thou not known that I have authority to crucify thee , and I have authority to release thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , ' Thou wouldst have no authority against me , if it were not having been given thee from above ; because of this , he who is delivering me up to thee hath greater sin . ' <EOV> <SOV> From this ' time ' was Pilate seeking to release him , and the Jews were crying out , saying , ' If this one thou mayest release , thou art not a friend of Caesar ; every one making himself a king , doth speak against Caesar . ' <EOV> <SOV> Pilate , therefore , having heard this word , brought Jesus without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place called , ' Pavement , ' and in Hebrew , Gabbatha ; <EOV> <SOV> and it was the preparation of the passover , and as it were the sixth hour , and he saith to the Jews , ' Lo , your king ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and they cried out , ' Take away , take away , crucify him ; ' Pilate saith to them , ' Your king shall I crucify ? ' the chief priests answered , ' We have no king except Caesar . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then , therefore , he delivered him up to them , that he may be crucified , and they took Jesus and led ' him ' away , <EOV> <SOV> and bearing his cross , he went forth to the place called ' Place ' of a Skull , which is called in Hebrew Golgotha ; <EOV> <SOV> where they crucified him , and with him two others , on this side , and on that side , and Jesus in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate also wrote a title , and put ' it ' on the cross , and it was written , ' Jesus the Nazarene , the king of the Jews ; ' <EOV> <SOV> this title , therefore , read many of the Jews , because the place was nigh to the city where Jesus was crucified , and it was having been written in Hebrew , in Greek , in Roman . <EOV> <SOV> The chief priests of the Jews said , therefore , to Pilate , ' Write not -- The king of the Jews , but that one said , I am king of the Jews ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , ' What I have written , I have written . ' <EOV> <SOV> The soldiers , therefore , when they did crucify Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to each soldier a part , also the coat , and the coat was seamless , from the top woven throughout , <EOV> <SOV> they said , therefore , to one another , ' We may not rend it , but cast a lot for it , whose it shall be ; ' that the Writing might be fulfilled , that is saying , ' They divided my garments to themselves , and upon my raiment they did cast a lot ; ' the soldiers , therefore , indeed , did these things . <EOV> <SOV> And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary of Cleopas , and Mary the Magdalene ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , having seen ' his ' mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he was loving , he saith to his mother , ' Woman , lo , thy son ; ' <EOV> <SOV> afterward he saith to the disciple , ' Lo , thy mother ; ' and from that hour the disciple took her to his own ' home ' . <EOV> <SOV> After this , Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished , that the Writing may be fulfilled , saith , ' I thirst ; ' <EOV> <SOV> a vessel , therefore , was placed full of vinegar , and they having filled a sponge with vinegar , and having put ' it ' around a hyssop stalk , did put ' it ' to his mouth ; <EOV> <SOV> when , therefore , Jesus received the vinegar , he said , ' It hath been finished ; ' and having bowed the head , gave up the spirit . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews , therefore , that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath , since it was the preparation , ( for that sabbath day was a great one , ) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken , and they taken away . <EOV> <SOV> The soldiers , therefore , came , and of the first indeed they did break the legs , and of the other who was crucified with him , <EOV> <SOV> and having come to Jesus , when they saw him already having been dead , they did not break his legs ; <EOV> <SOV> but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side , and immediately there came forth blood and water ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who hath seen hath testified , and his testimony is true , and that one hath known that true things he speaketh , that ye also may believe . <EOV> <SOV> For these things came to pass , that the Writing may be fulfilled , ' A bone of him shall not be broken ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and again another Writing saith , ' They shall look to him whom they did pierce . ' <EOV> <SOV> And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a disciple of Jesus , but concealed , through the fear of the Jews -- ask of Pilate , that he may take away the body of Jesus , and Pilate gave leave ; he came , therefore , and took away the body of Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , as it were , a hundred pounds . <EOV> <SOV> They took , therefore , the body of Jesus , and bound it with linen clothes with the spices , according as it was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial ; <EOV> <SOV> and there was in the place where he was crucified a garden , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one was yet laid ; <EOV> <SOV> there , therefore , because of the preparation of the Jews , because the tomb was nigh , they laid Jesus . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And on the first of the sabbaths , Mary the Magdalene doth come early ( there being yet darkness ) to the tomb , and she seeth the stone having been taken away out of the tomb , <EOV> <SOV> she runneth , therefore , and cometh unto Simon Peter , and unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving , and saith to them , ' They took away the Lord out of the tomb , and we have not known where they laid him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Peter , therefore , went forth , and the other disciple , and they were coming to the tomb , <EOV> <SOV> and the two were running together , and the other disciple did run forward more quickly than Peter , and came first to the tomb , <EOV> <SOV> and having stooped down , seeth the linen clothes lying , yet , indeed , he entered not . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter , therefore , cometh , following him , and he entered into the tomb , and beholdeth the linen clothes lying , <EOV> <SOV> and the napkin that was upon his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but apart , having been folded up , in one place ; <EOV> <SOV> then , therefore , entered also the other disciple who came first unto the tomb , and he saw , and did believe ; <EOV> <SOV> for not yet did they know the Writing , that it behoveth him out of the dead to rise again . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples therefore went away again unto their own friends , <EOV> <SOV> and Mary was standing near the tomb , weeping without ; as she was weeping , then , she stooped down to the tomb , and beholdeth two messengers in white , sitting , <EOV> <SOV> one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had been laid . <EOV> <SOV> And they say to her , ' Woman , why dost thou weep ? ' she saith to them , ' Because they took away my Lord , and I have not known where they laid him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and these things having said , she turned backward , and seeth Jesus standing , and she had not known that it is Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' Woman , why dost thou weep ? whom dost thou seek ; ' she , supposing that he is the gardener , saith to him , ' Sir , if thou didst carry him away , tell me where thou didst lay him , and I will take him away ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' Mary ! ' having turned , she saith to him , ' Rabbouni ; ' that is to say , ' Teacher . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , ' Be not touching me , for I have not yet ascended unto my Father ; and be going on to my brethren , and say to them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father , and to my God , and to your God . ' <EOV> <SOV> Mary the Magdalene cometh , telling to the disciples that she hath seen the Lord , and ' that ' these things he said to her . <EOV> <SOV> It being , therefore , evening , on that day , the first of the sabbaths , and the doors having been shut where the disciples were assembled , through fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and saith to them , ' Peace to you ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and this having said , he shewed them his hands and side ; the disciples , therefore , rejoiced , having seen the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , said to them again , ' Peace to you ; according as the Father hath sent me , I also send you ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and this having said , he breathed on ' them ' , and saith to them , ' Receive the Holy Spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> if of any ye may loose the sins , they are loosed to them ; if of any ye may retain , they have been retained . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Thomas , one of the twelve , who is called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came ; <EOV> <SOV> the other disciples , therefore , said to him , ' We have seen the Lord ; ' and he said to them , ' If I may not see in his hands the mark of the nails , and may put my finger to the mark of the nails , and may put my hand to his side , I will not believe . ' <EOV> <SOV> And after eight days , again were his disciples within , and Thomas with them ; Jesus cometh , the doors having been shut , and he stood in the midst , and said , ' Peace to you ! ' <EOV> <SOV> then he saith to Thomas , ' Bring thy finger hither , and see my hands , and bring thy hand , and put ' it ' to my side , and become not unbelieving , but believing . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Thomas answered and said to him , ' My Lord and my God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' Because thou hast seen me , Thomas , thou hast believed ; happy those not having seen , and having believed . ' <EOV> <SOV> Many indeed , therefore , other signs also did Jesus before his disciples , that are not written in this book ; <EOV> <SOV> and these have been written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing ye may have life in his name . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things did Jesus manifest himself again to the disciples on the sea of Tiberias , and he did manifest himself thus : <EOV> <SOV> There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas who is called Didymus , and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee , and the ' sons ' of Zebedee , and two others of his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith to them , ' I go away to fish ; ' they say to him , ' We go -- we also -- with thee ; ' they went forth and entered into the boat immediately , and on that night they caught nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And morning being now come , Jesus stood at the shore , yet indeed the disciples did not know that it is Jesus ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , saith to them , ' Lads , have ye any meat ? ' <EOV> <SOV> they answered him , ' No ; ' and he said to them , ' Cast the net at the right side of the boat , and ye shall find ; ' they cast , therefore , and no longer were they able to draw it , from the multitude of the fishes . <EOV> <SOV> That disciple , therefore , whom Jesus was loving saith to Peter , ' The Lord it is ! ' Simon Peter , therefore , having heard that it is the Lord , did gird on the outer coat , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea ; <EOV> <SOV> and the other disciples came by the little boat , for they were not far from the land , but as it were about two hundred cubits off , dragging the net of the fishes ; <EOV> <SOV> when , therefore , they came to the land , they behold a fire of coals lying , and a fish lying on it , and bread . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , ' Bring ye from the fishes that ye caught now ; ' <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter went up , and drew the net up on the land , full of great fishes , an hundred fifty and three , and though they were so many , the net was not rent . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , ' Come ye , dine ; ' and none of the disciples was venturing to inquire of him , ' Who art thou ? ' knowing that it is the Lord ; <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , therefore , doth come and take the bread and give to them , and the fish in like manner ; <EOV> <SOV> this ' is ' now a third time Jesus was manifested to his disciples , having been raised from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> When , therefore , they dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , ' Simon , ' son ' of Jonas , dost thou love me more than these ? ' he saith to him , ' Yes , Lord ; thou hast known that I dearly love thee ; ' he saith to him , ' Feed my lambs . ' <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him again , a second time , ' Simon , ' son ' of Jonas , dost thou love me ? ' he saith to him , ' Yes , Lord ; thou hast known that I dearly love thee ; ' he saith to him , ' Tend my sheep . ' <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him the third time , ' Simon , ' son ' of Jonas , dost thou dearly love me ? ' Peter was grieved that he said to him the third time , ' Dost thou dearly love me ? ' and he said to him , ' Lord , thou hast known all things ; thou dost know that I dearly love thee . ' Jesus saith to him , ' Feed my sheep ; <EOV> <SOV> verily , verily , I say to thee , When thou wast younger , thou wast girding thyself and wast walking whither thou didst will , but when thou mayest be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another will gird thee , and shall carry ' thee ' whither thou dost not will ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and this he said , signifying by what death he shall glorify God ; and having said this , he saith to him , ' Be following me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter having turned about doth see the disciple whom Jesus was loving following , ( who also reclined in the supper on his breast , and said , ' Sir , who is he who is delivering thee up ? ' ) <EOV> <SOV> Peter having seen this one , saith to Jesus , ' Lord , and what of this one ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' If him I will to remain till I come , what -- to thee ? be thou following me . ' This word , therefore , went forth to the brethren that that disciple doth not die , <EOV> <SOV> yet Jesus did not say to him , that he doth not die , but , ' If him I will to remain till I come , what -- to thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things , and he wrote these things , and we have known that his testimony is true . <EOV> <SOV> And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus did -- which , if they may be written one by one , not even the world itself I think to have place for the books written . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
