<SOC> <SOV> A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ , son of David , son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Abraham begat Isaac , and Isaac begat Jacob , and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren , <EOV> <SOV> and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar , and Pharez begat Hezron , and Hezron begat Ram , <EOV> <SOV> and Ram begat Amminadab , and Amminadab begat Nahshon , and Nahshon begat Salmon , <EOV> <SOV> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab , and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth , and Obed begat Jesse , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesse begat David the king . And David the king begat Solomon , of her ' who had been ' Uriah 's , <EOV> <SOV> and Solomon begat Rehoboam , and Rehoboam begat Abijah , and Abijah begat Asa , <EOV> <SOV> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat , and Jehoshaphat begat Joram , and Joram begat Uzziah , <EOV> <SOV> and Uzziah begat Jotham , and Jotham begat Ahaz , and Ahaz begat Hezekiah , <EOV> <SOV> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh , and Manasseh begat Amon , and Amon begat Josiah , <EOV> <SOV> and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren , at the Babylonian removal . <EOV> <SOV> And after the Babylonian removal , Jeconiah begat Shealtiel , and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel , <EOV> <SOV> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud , and Abiud begat Eliakim , and Eliakim begat Azor , <EOV> <SOV> and Azor begat Sadok , and Sadok begat Achim , and Achim begat Eliud , <EOV> <SOV> and Eliud begat Eleazar , and Eleazar begat Matthan , and Matthan begat Jacob , <EOV> <SOV> and Jacob begat Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was begotten Jesus , who is named Christ . <EOV> <SOV> All the generations , therefore , from Abraham unto David ' are ' fourteen generations , and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations , and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ , fourteen generations . <EOV> <SOV> And of Jesus Christ , the birth was thus : For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph , before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit , <EOV> <SOV> and Joseph her husband being righteous , and not willing to make her an example , did wish privately to send her away . <EOV> <SOV> And on his thinking of these things , lo , a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him , saying , ' Joseph , son of David , thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife , for that which in her was begotten ' is ' of the Holy Spirit , <EOV> <SOV> and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus , for he shall save his people from their sins . ' <EOV> <SOV> And all this hath come to pass , that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Lo , the virgin shall conceive , and she shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , ' which is , being interpreted ' With us ' he is ' God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph , having risen from the sleep , did as the messenger of the Lord directed him , and received his wife , <EOV> <SOV> and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first - born , and he called his name Jesus . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus having been born in Beth - Lehem of Judea , in the days of Herod the king , lo , mages from the east came to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Where is he who was born king of the Jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and we came to bow to him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Herod the king having heard , was stirred , and all Jerusalem with him , <EOV> <SOV> and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , ' In Beth - Lehem of Judea , for thus it hath been written through the prophet , <EOV> <SOV> And thou , Beth - Lehem , the land of Judah , thou art by no means the least among the leaders of Judah , for out of thee shall come one leading , who shall feed My people Israel . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod , privately having called the mages , did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star , <EOV> <SOV> and having sent them to Beth - Lehem , he said , ' Having gone -- inquire ye exactly for the child , and whenever ye may have found , bring me back word , that I also having come may bow to him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they , having heard the king , departed , and lo , the star , that they did see in the east , did go before them , till , having come , it stood over where the child was . <EOV> <SOV> And having seen the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy , <EOV> <SOV> and having come to the house , they found the child with Mary his mother , and having fallen down they bowed to him , and having opened their treasures , they presented to him gifts , gold , and frankincense , and myrrh , <EOV> <SOV> and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod , through another way they withdrew to their own region . <EOV> <SOV> And on their having withdrawn , lo , a messenger of the Lord doth appear in a dream to Joseph , saying , ' Having risen , take the child and his mother , and flee to Egypt , and be thou there till I may speak to thee , for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , having risen , took the child and his mother by night , and withdrew to Egypt , <EOV> <SOV> and he was there till the death of Herod , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , ' Out of Egypt I did call My Son . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod , having seen that he was deceived by the mages , was very wroth , and having sent forth , he slew all the male children in Beth - Lehem , and in all its borders , from two years and under , according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping ' for ' her children , and she would not be comforted because they are not . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Herod having died , lo , a messenger of the Lord in a dream doth appear to Joseph in Egypt , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Having risen , take the child and his mother , and be going to the land of Israel , for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , having risen , took the child and his mother , and came to the land of Israel , <EOV> <SOV> and having heard that Archelaus doth reign over Judea instead of Herod his father , he was afraid to go thither , and having been divinely warned in a dream , he withdrew to the parts of Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and coming , he dwelt in a city named Nazareth , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets , that ' A Nazarene he shall be called . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And in those days cometh John the Baptist , proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , ' Reform , for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens , ' <EOV> <SOV> for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet , saying , ' A voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , straight make ye His paths . ' <EOV> <SOV> And this John had his clothing of camel 's hair , and a girdle of skin round his loins , and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field . <EOV> <SOV> Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem , and all Judea , and all the region round about the Jordan , <EOV> <SOV> and they were baptized in the Jordan by him , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism , he said to them , ' Brood of vipers ! who did shew you to flee from the coming wrath ? <EOV> <SOV> bear , therefore , fruits worthy of the reformation , <EOV> <SOV> and do not think to say in yourselves , A father we have -- Abraham , for I say to you , that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham , <EOV> <SOV> and now also , the axe unto the root of the trees is laid , every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down , and to fire is cast . <EOV> <SOV> ' I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation , but he who after me is coming is mightier than I , of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals , he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire , <EOV> <SOV> whose fan ' is ' in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor , and will gather his wheat to the storehouse , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan , unto John to be baptized by him , <EOV> <SOV> but John was forbidding him , saying , ' I have need by thee to be baptized -- and thou dost come unto me ! ' <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answering said to him , ' Suffer now , for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness , ' then he doth suffer him . <EOV> <SOV> And having been baptized , Jesus went up immediately from the water , and lo , opened to him were the heavens , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a voice out of the heavens , saying , ' This is My Son -- the Beloved , in whom I did delight . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit , to be tempted by the Devil , <EOV> <SOV> and having fasted forty days and forty nights , afterwards he did hunger . <EOV> <SOV> And the Tempter having come to him said , ' If Son thou art of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves . ' <EOV> <SOV> But he answering said , ' It hath been written , Not upon bread alone doth man live , but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then doth the Devil take him to the ' holy ' city , and doth set him on the pinnacle of the temple , <EOV> <SOV> and saith to him , ' If Son thou art of God -- cast thyself down , for it hath been written , that , His messengers He shall charge concerning thee , and on hands they shall bear thee up , that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him again , ' It hath been written , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . ' <EOV> <SOV> Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount , and doth shew to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them , <EOV> <SOV> and saith to him , ' All these to thee I will give , if falling down thou mayest bow to me . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus to him , ' Go -- Adversary , for it hath been written , The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to , and Him only thou shalt serve . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then doth the Devil leave him , and lo , messengers came and were ministering to him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up , did withdraw to Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and having left Nazareth , having come , he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea , in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim , <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali , way of the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the nations ! -- <EOV> <SOV> the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light , and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them . ' <EOV> <SOV> From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say , ' Reform ye , for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brothers , Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother , casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers -- <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' Come ye after me , and I will make you fishers of men , ' <EOV> <SOV> and they , immediately , having left the nets , did follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And having advanced thence , he saw other two brothers , James of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , refitting their nets , and he called them , <EOV> <SOV> and they , immediately , having left the boat and their father , did follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues , and proclaiming the good news of the reign , and healing every disease , and every malady among the people , <EOV> <SOV> and his fame went forth to all Syria , and they brought to him all having ailments , pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains , and demoniacs , and lunatics , and paralytics , and he healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee , and Decapolis , and Jerusalem , and Judea , and beyond the Jordan . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having seen the multitudes , he went up to the mount , and he having sat down , his disciples came to him , <EOV> <SOV> and having opened his mouth , he was teaching them , saying : <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy the mourning -- because they shall be comforted . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy the meek -- because they shall inherit the land . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy the kind -- because they shall find kindness . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy the clean in heart -- because they shall see God . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons of God . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy those persecuted for righteousness ' sake -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you , and may persecute , and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake -- <EOV> <SOV> rejoice ye and be glad , because your reward ' is ' great in the heavens , for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye are the salt of the land , but if the salt may lose savour , in what shall it be salted ? for nothing is it good henceforth , except to be cast without , and to be trodden down by men . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye are the light of the world , a city set upon a mount is not able to be hid ; <EOV> <SOV> nor do they light a lamp , and put it under the measure , but on the lamp - stand , and it shineth to all those in the house ; <EOV> <SOV> so let your light shine before men , that they may see your good works , and may glorify your Father who ' is ' in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the prophets -- I did not come to throw down , but to fulfill ; <EOV> <SOV> for , verily I say to you , till that the heaven and the earth may pass away , one iota or one tittle may not pass away from the law , till that all may come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> ' Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so , least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens , but whoever may do and may teach ' them ' , he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' For I say to you , that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees , ye may not enter to the reign of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye heard that it was said to the ancients : Thou shalt not kill , and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment ; <EOV> <SOV> but I -- I say to you , that every one who is angry at his brother without cause , shall be in danger of the judgment , and whoever may say to his brother , Empty fellow ! shall be in danger of the sanhedrim , and whoever may say , Rebel ! shall be in danger of the gehenna of the fire . <EOV> <SOV> ' If , therefore , thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar , and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything against thee , <EOV> <SOV> leave there thy gift before the altar , and go -- first be reconciled to thy brother , and then having come bring thy gift . <EOV> <SOV> ' Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly , while thou art in the way with him , that the opponent may not deliver thee to the judge , and the judge may deliver thee to the officer , and to prison thou mayest be cast , <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to thee , thou mayest not come forth thence till that thou mayest pay the last farthing . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye heard that it was said to the ancients : Thou shalt not commit adultery ; <EOV> <SOV> but I -- I say to you , that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her , did already commit adultery with her in his heart . <EOV> <SOV> ' But , if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble , pluck it out and cast from thee , for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish , and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna . <EOV> <SOV> ' And , if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble , cut it off , and cast from thee , for it is good to thee that one of thy members may perish , and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna . <EOV> <SOV> ' And it was said , That whoever may put away his wife , let him give to her a writing of divorce ; <EOV> <SOV> but I -- I say to you , that whoever may put away his wife , save for the matter of whoredom , doth make her to commit adultery ; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth commit adultery . <EOV> <SOV> ' Again , ye heard that it was said to the ancients : Thou shalt not swear falsely , but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine oaths ; <EOV> <SOV> but I -- I say to you , not to swear at all ; neither by the heaven , because it is the throne of God , <EOV> <SOV> nor by the earth , because it is His footstool , nor by Jerusalem , because it is a city of a great king , <EOV> <SOV> nor by thy head mayest thou swear , because thou art not able one hair to make white or black ; <EOV> <SOV> but let your word be , Yes , Yes , No , No , and that which is more than these is of the evil . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye heard that it was said : Eye for eye , and tooth for tooth ; <EOV> <SOV> but I -- I say to you , not to resist the evil , but whoever shall slap thee on thy right cheek , turn to him also the other ; <EOV> <SOV> and whoever is willing to take thee to law , and thy coat to take -- suffer to him also the cloak . <EOV> <SOV> ' And whoever shall impress thee one mile , go with him two , <EOV> <SOV> to him who is asking of thee be giving , and him who is willing to borrow from thee thou mayest not turn away . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye heard that it was said : Thou shalt love thy neighbor , and shalt hate thine enemy ; <EOV> <SOV> but I -- I say to you , Love your enemies , bless those cursing you , do good to those hating you , and pray for those accusing you falsely , and persecuting you , <EOV> <SOV> that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens , because His sun He doth cause to rise on evil and good , and He doth send rain on righteous and unrighteous . <EOV> <SOV> ' For , if ye may love those loving you , what reward have ye ? do not also the tax - gatherers the same ? <EOV> <SOV> and if ye may salute your brethren only , what do ye abundant ? do not also the tax - gatherers so ? <EOV> <SOV> ye shall therefore be perfect , as your Father who ' is ' in the heavens is perfect . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' Take heed your kindness not to do before men , to be seen by them , and if not -- reward ye have not from your Father who ' is ' in the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> whenever , therefore , thou mayest do kindness , thou mayest not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do , in the synagogues , and in the streets , that they may have glory from men ; verily I say to you -- they have their reward ! <EOV> <SOV> ' But thou , doing kindness , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth , <EOV> <SOV> that thy kindness may be in secret , and thy Father who is seeing in secret Himself shall reward thee manifestly . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when thou mayest pray , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites , because they love in the synagogues , and in the corners of the broad places -- standing -- to pray , that they may be seen of men ; verily I say to you , that they have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> ' But thou , when thou mayest pray , go into thy chamber , and having shut thy door , pray to thy Father who ' is ' in secret , and thy Father who is seeing in secret , shall reward thee manifestly . <EOV> <SOV> ' And -- praying -- ye may not use vain repetitions like the nations , for they think that in their much speaking they shall be heard , <EOV> <SOV> be ye not therefore like to them , for your Father doth know those things that ye have need of before your asking him ; <EOV> <SOV> thus therefore pray ye : ' Our Father who ' art ' in the heavens ! hallowed be Thy name . <EOV> <SOV> ' Thy reign come : Thy will come to pass , as in heaven also on the earth . <EOV> <SOV> ' Our appointed bread give us to - day . <EOV> <SOV> ' And forgive us our debts , as also we forgive our debtors . <EOV> <SOV> ' And mayest Thou not lead us to temptation , but deliver us from the evil , because Thine is the reign , and the power , and the glory -- to the ages . Amen . <EOV> <SOV> ' For , if ye may forgive men their trespasses He also will forgive you -- your Father who ' is ' in the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> but if ye may not forgive men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when ye may fast , be ye not as the hypocrites , of sour countenances , for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear to men fasting ; verily I say to you , that they have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> ' But thou , fasting , anoint thy head , and wash thy face , <EOV> <SOV> that thou mayest not appear to men fasting , but to thy Father who ' is ' in secret , and thy Father , who is seeing in secret , shall reward thee manifestly . <EOV> <SOV> ' Treasure not up to yourselves treasures on the earth , where moth and rust disfigure , and where thieves break through and steal , <EOV> <SOV> but treasure up to yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth disfigure , and where thieves do not break through nor steal , <EOV> <SOV> for where your treasure is , there will be also your heart . <EOV> <SOV> ' The lamp of the body is the eye , if , therefore , thine eye may be perfect , all thy body shall be enlightened , <EOV> <SOV> but if thine eye may be evil , all thy body shall be dark ; if , therefore , the light that ' is ' in thee is darkness -- the darkness , how great ! <EOV> <SOV> ' None is able to serve two lords , for either he will hate the one and love the other , or he will hold to the one , and despise the other ; ye are not able to serve God and Mammon . <EOV> <SOV> ' Because of this I say to you , be not anxious for your life , what ye may eat , and what ye may drink , nor for your body , what ye may put on . Is not the life more than the nourishment , and the body than the clothing ? <EOV> <SOV> look to the fowls of the heaven , for they do not sow , nor reap , nor gather into storehouses , and your heavenly Father doth nourish them ; are not ye much better than they ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And who of you , being anxious , is able to add to his age one cubit ? <EOV> <SOV> and about clothing why are ye anxious ? consider well the lilies of the field ; how do they grow ? they do not labour , nor do they spin ; <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these . <EOV> <SOV> ' And if the herb of the field , that to - day is , and to - morrow is cast to the furnace , God doth so clothe -- not much more you , O ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> therefore ye may not be anxious , saying , What may we eat ? or , What may we drink ? or , What may we put round ? <EOV> <SOV> for all these do the nations seek for , for your heavenly Father doth know that ye have need of all these ; <EOV> <SOV> but seek ye first the reign of God and His righteousness , and all these shall be added to you . <EOV> <SOV> Be not therefore anxious for the morrow , for the morrow shall be anxious for its own things ; sufficient for the day ' is ' the evil of it . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' Judge not , that ye may not be judged , <EOV> <SOV> for in what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged , and in what measure ye measure , it shall be measured to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' And why dost thou behold the mote that ' is ' in thy brother 's eye , and the beam that ' is ' in thine own eye dost not consider ? <EOV> <SOV> or , how wilt thou say to thy brother , Suffer I may cast out the mote from thine eye , and lo , the beam ' is ' in thine own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye may not give that which is ' holy ' to the dogs , nor cast your pearls before the swine , that they may not trample them among their feet , and having turned -- may rend you . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you ; <EOV> <SOV> for every one who is asking doth receive , and he who is seeking doth find , and to him who is knocking it shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> ' Or what man is of you , of whom , if his son may ask a loaf -- a stone will he present to him ? <EOV> <SOV> and if a fish he may ask -- a serpent will he present to him ? <EOV> <SOV> if , therefore , ye being evil , have known good gifts to give to your children , how much more shall your Father who ' is ' in the heavens give good things to those asking him ? <EOV> <SOV> ' All things , therefore , whatever ye may will that men may be doing to you , so also do to them , for this is the law and the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> ' Go ye in through the strait gate , because wide ' is ' the gate , and broad the way that is leading to the destruction , and many are those going in through it ; <EOV> <SOV> how strait ' is ' the gate , and compressed the way that is leading to the life , and few are those finding it ! <EOV> <SOV> ' But , take heed of the false prophets , who come unto you in sheep 's clothing , and inwardly are ravening wolves . <EOV> <SOV> From their fruits ye shall know them ; do ' men ' gather from thorns grapes ? or from thistles figs ? <EOV> <SOV> so every good tree doth yield good fruits , but the bad tree doth yield evil fruits . <EOV> <SOV> A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits , nor a bad tree to yield good fruits . <EOV> <SOV> Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire : <EOV> <SOV> therefore from their fruits ye shall know them . <EOV> <SOV> ' Not every one who is saying to me Lord , lord , shall come into the reign of the heavens ; but he who is doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> Many will say to me in that day , Lord , lord , have we not in thy name prophesied ? and in thy name cast out demons ? and in thy name done many mighty things ? <EOV> <SOV> and then I will acknowledge to them , that -- I never knew you , depart from me ye who are working lawlessness . <EOV> <SOV> ' Therefore , every one who doth hear of me these words , and doth do them , I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock ; <EOV> <SOV> and the rain did descend , and the streams came , and the winds blew , and they beat on that house , and it fell not , for it had been founded on the rock . <EOV> <SOV> ' And every one who is hearing of me these words , and is not doing them , shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand ; <EOV> <SOV> and the rain did descend , and the streams came , and the winds blew , and they beat on that house , and it fell , and its fall was great . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus ended these words , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching , <EOV> <SOV> for he was teaching them as having authority , and not as the scribes . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when he came down from the mount , great multitudes did follow him , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a leper having come , was bowing to him , saying , ' Sir , if thou art willing , thou art able to cleanse me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having stretched forth the hand , Jesus touched him , saying , ' I will , be thou cleansed , ' and immediately his leprosy was cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to him , ' See , thou mayest tell no one , but go , thyself shew to the priest , and bring the gift that Moses commanded for a testimony to them . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having entered into Capernaum , there came to him a centurion calling upon him , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , ' Sir , my young man hath been laid in the house a paralytic , fearfully afflicted , ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus saith to him , ' I , having come , will heal him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the centurion answering said , ' Sir , I am not worthy that thou mayest enter under my roof , but only say a word , and my servant shall be healed ; <EOV> <SOV> for I also am a man under authority , having under myself soldiers , and I say to this one , Go , and he goeth , and to another , Be coming , and he cometh , and to my servant , Do this , and he doth ' it ' . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having heard , did wonder , and said to those following , ' Verily I say to you , not even in Israel so great faith have I found ; <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , that many from east and west shall come and recline ( at meat ) with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the reign of the heavens , <EOV> <SOV> but the sons of the reign shall be cast forth to the outer darkness -- there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to the centurion , ' Go , and as thou didst believe let it be to thee ; ' and his young man was healed in that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having come into the house of Peter , saw his mother - in - law laid , and fevered , <EOV> <SOV> and he touched her hand , and the fever left her , and she arose , and was ministering to them . <EOV> <SOV> And evening having come , they brought to him many demoniacs , and he did cast out the spirits with a word , and did heal all who were ill , <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , ' Himself took our infirmities , and the sicknesses he did bear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having seen great multitudes about him , did command to depart to the other side ; <EOV> <SOV> and a certain scribe having come , said to him , ' Teacher , I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus saith to him , ' The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven places of rest , but the Son of Man hath not where he may lay the head . ' <EOV> <SOV> And another of his disciples said to him , ' Sir , permit me first to depart and to bury my father ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to him , ' Follow me , and suffer the dead to bury their own dead . ' <EOV> <SOV> And when he entered into the boat his disciples did follow him , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a great tempest arose in the sea , so that the boat was being covered by the waves , but he was sleeping , <EOV> <SOV> and his disciples having come to him , awoke him , saying , ' Sir , save us ; we are perishing . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , ' Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? ' Then having risen , he rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was a great calm ; <EOV> <SOV> and the men wondered , saying , ' What kind -- is this , that even the wind and the sea do obey him ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he having come to the other side , to the region of the Gergesenes , there met him two demoniacs , coming forth out of the tombs , very fierce , so that no one was able to pass over by that way , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , they cried out , saying , ' What -- to us and to thee , Jesus , Son of God ? didst thou come hither , before the time , to afflict us ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding , <EOV> <SOV> and the demons were calling on him , saying , ' If thou dost cast us forth , permit us to go away to the herd of the swine ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' Go . ' And having come forth , they went to the herd of the swine , and lo , the whole herd of the swine rushed down the steep , to the sea , and died in the waters , <EOV> <SOV> and those feeding did flee , and , having gone to the city , they declared all , and the matter of the demoniacs . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , all the city came forth to meet Jesus , and having seen him , they called on ' him ' that he might depart from their borders . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having gone to the boat , he passed over , and came to his own city , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , they were bringing to him a paralytic , laid upon a couch , and Jesus having seen their faith , said to the paralytic , ' Be of good courage , child , thy sins have been forgiven thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And lo , certain of the scribes said within themselves , ' This one doth speak evil . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having known their thoughts , said , ' Why think ye evil in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> for which is easier ? to say , The sins have been forgiven to thee ; or to say , Rise , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> ' But , that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon the earth to forgive sins -- ( then saith he to the paralytic ) -- having risen , take up thy couch , and go to thy house . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , having risen , went to his house , <EOV> <SOV> and the multitudes having seen , wondered , and glorified God , who did give such power to men . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus passing by thence , saw a man sitting at the tax - office , named Matthew , and saith to him , ' Be following me , ' and he , having risen , did follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , he reclining ( at meat ) in the house , that lo , many tax - gatherers and sinners having come , were lying ( at meat ) with Jesus and his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees having seen , said to his disciples , ' Wherefore with the tax - gatherers and sinners doth your teacher eat ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having heard , said to them , ' They who are whole have no need of a physician , but they who are ill ; <EOV> <SOV> but having gone , learn ye what is , Kindness I will , and not sacrifice , for I did not come to call righteous men , but sinners , to reformation . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then come to him do the disciples of John , saying , ' Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much , and thy disciples fast not ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , ' Can the sons of the bride - chamber mourn , so long as the bridegroom is with them ? but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them , and then they shall fast . <EOV> <SOV> ' And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment , for its filling up doth take from the garment , and a worse rent is made . <EOV> <SOV> ' Nor do they put new wine into old skins , and if not -- the skins burst , and the wine doth run out , and the skins are destroyed , but they put new wine into new skins , and both are preserved together . ' <EOV> <SOV> While he is speaking these things to them , lo , a ruler having come , was bowing to him , saying that ' My daughter just now died , but , having come , lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having risen , did follow him , also his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , having come to him behind , did touch the fringe of his garments , <EOV> <SOV> for she said within herself , ' If only I may touch his garment , I shall be saved . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having turned about , and having seen her , said , ' Be of good courage , daughter , thy faith hath saved thee , ' and the woman was saved from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler , and having seen the minstrels and the multitude making tumult , <EOV> <SOV> he saith to them , ' Withdraw , for the damsel did not die , but doth sleep , ' and they were deriding him ; <EOV> <SOV> but , when the multitude was put forth , having gone in , he took hold of her hand , and the damsel arose , <EOV> <SOV> and the fame of this went forth to all the land . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus passing on thence , two blind men followed him , calling and saying , ' Deal kindly with us , Son of David . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he having come to the house , the blind men came to him , and Jesus saith to them , ' Believe ye that I am able to do this ? ' They say to him , ' Yes , sir . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then touched he their eyes , saying , ' According to your faith let it be to you , ' <EOV> <SOV> and their eyes were opened , and Jesus strictly charged them , saying , ' See , let no one know ; ' <EOV> <SOV> but they , having gone forth , did spread his fame in all that land . <EOV> <SOV> And as they are coming forth , lo , they brought to him a man dumb , a demoniac , <EOV> <SOV> and the demon having been cast out , the dumb spake , and the multitude did wonder , saying that ' It was never so seen in Israel : ' <EOV> <SOV> but the Pharisees said , ' By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and proclaiming the good news of the reign , and healing every sickness and every malady among the people . <EOV> <SOV> And having seen the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , that they were faint and cast aside , as sheep not having a shepherd , <EOV> <SOV> then saith he to his disciples , ' The harvest indeed ' is ' abundant , but the workmen few ; <EOV> <SOV> beseech ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he may put forth workmen to His harvest . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having called to him his twelve disciples , he gave to them power over unclean spirits , so as to be casting them out , and to be healing every sickness , and every malady . <EOV> <SOV> And of the twelve apostles the names are these : first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James of Zebedee , and John his brother ; <EOV> <SOV> Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the tax - gatherer ; James of Alpheus , and Lebbeus who was surnamed Thaddeus ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon the Cananite , and Judas Iscariot , who did also deliver him up . <EOV> <SOV> These twelve did Jesus send forth , having given command to them , saying , ' To the way of the nations go not away , and into a city of the Samaritans go not in , <EOV> <SOV> and be going rather unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> ' And , going on , proclaim saying that , the reign of the heavens hath come nigh ; <EOV> <SOV> infirm ones be healing , lepers be cleansing , dead be raising , demons be casting out -- freely ye did receive , freely give . <EOV> <SOV> ' Provide not gold , nor silver , nor brass in your girdles , <EOV> <SOV> nor scrip for the way , nor two coats , nor sandals , nor staff -- for the workman is worthy of his nourishment . <EOV> <SOV> ' And into whatever city or village ye may enter , inquire ye who in it is worthy , and there abide , till ye may go forth . <EOV> <SOV> And coming to the house salute it , <EOV> <SOV> and if indeed the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it ; and if it be not worthy , let your peace turn back to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' And whoever may not receive you nor hear your words , coming forth from that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet , <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> ' Lo , I do send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves , be ye therefore wise as the serpents , and simple as the doves . <EOV> <SOV> And , take ye heed of men , for they will give you up to sanhedrims , and in their synagogues they will scourge you , <EOV> <SOV> and before governors and kings ye shall be brought for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations . <EOV> <SOV> ' And whenever they may deliver you up , be not anxious how or what ye may speak , for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak ; <EOV> <SOV> for ye are not the speakers , but the Spirit of your Father that is speaking in you . <EOV> <SOV> ' And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child , and children shall rise up against parents , and shall put them to death , <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall be hated by all because of my name , but he who hath endured to the end , he shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> ' And whenever they may persecute you in this city , flee to the other , for verily I say to you , ye may not have completed the cities of Israel till the Son of Man may come . <EOV> <SOV> ' A disciple is not above the teacher , nor a servant above his lord ; <EOV> <SOV> sufficient to the disciple that he may be as his teacher , and the servant as his lord ; if the master of the house they did call Beelzeboul , how much more those of his household ? <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye may not , therefore , fear them , for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed , and hid , that shall not be known ; <EOV> <SOV> that which I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light , and that which you hear at the ear , proclaim on the house - tops . <EOV> <SOV> ' And be not afraid of those killing the body , and are not able to kill the soul , but fear rather Him who is able both soul and body to destroy in gehenna . <EOV> <SOV> ' Are not two sparrows sold for an assar ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father ; <EOV> <SOV> and of you -- even the hairs of the head are all numbered ; <EOV> <SOV> be not therefore afraid , than many sparrows ye are better . <EOV> <SOV> ' Every one , therefore , who shall confess in me before men , I also will confess in him before my Father who is in the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> and whoever shall deny me before men , I also will deny him before my Father who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye may not suppose that I came to put peace on the earth ; I did not come to put peace , but a sword ; <EOV> <SOV> for I came to set a man at variance against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law , <EOV> <SOV> and the enemies of a man are those of his household . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is loving father or mother above me , is not worthy of me , and he who is loving son or daughter above me , is not worthy of me , <EOV> <SOV> and whoever doth not receive his cross and follow after me , is not worthy of me . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who found his life shall lose it , and he who lost his life for my sake shall find it . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is receiving you doth receive me , and he who is receiving me doth receive Him who sent me , <EOV> <SOV> he who is receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet , shall receive a prophet 's reward , and he who is receiving a righteous man in the name of a righteous man , shall receive a righteous man 's reward , <EOV> <SOV> and whoever may give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say to you , he may not lose his reward . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus ended directing his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities . <EOV> <SOV> And John having heard in the prison the works of the Christ , having sent two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> said to him , ' Art thou He who is coming , or for another do we look ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' Having gone , declare to John the things that ye hear and see , <EOV> <SOV> blind receive sight , and lame walk , lepers are cleansed , and deaf hear , dead are raised , and poor have good news proclaimed , <EOV> <SOV> and happy is he who may not be stumbled in me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And as they are going , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , ' What went ye out to the wilderness to view ? -- a reed shaken by the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> ' But what went ye out to see ? -- a man clothed in soft garments ? lo , those wearing the soft things are in the kings ' houses . <EOV> <SOV> ' But what went ye out to see ? -- a prophet ? yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet , <EOV> <SOV> for this is he of whom it hath been written , Lo , I do send My messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , there hath not risen , among those born of women , a greater than John the Baptist , but he who is least in the reign of the heavens is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> ' And , from the days of John the Baptist till now , the reign of the heavens doth suffer violence , and violent men do take it by force , <EOV> <SOV> for all the prophets and the law till John did prophesy , <EOV> <SOV> and if ye are willing to receive ' it ' , he is Elijah who was about to come ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> ' And to what shall I liken this generation ? it is like little children in market - places , sitting and calling to their comrades , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , We piped unto you , and ye did not dance , we lamented to you , and ye did not smite the breast . <EOV> <SOV> ' For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a demon ; <EOV> <SOV> the Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , Lo , a man , a glutton , and a wine - drinker , a friend of tax - gatherers and sinners , and wisdom was justified of her children . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then began he to reproach the cities in which were done most of his mighty works , because they did not reform . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to thee , Chorazin ! wo to thee , Bethsaida ! because , if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you , long ago in sackcloth and ashes they had reformed ; <EOV> <SOV> but I say to you , to Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than for you . <EOV> <SOV> ' And thou , Capernaum , which unto the heaven wast exalted , unto hades shalt be brought down , because if in Sodom had been done the mighty works that were done in thee , it had remained unto this day ; <EOV> <SOV> but I say to you , to the land of Sodom it shall be more tolerable in a day of judgment than to thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> At that time Jesus answering said , ' I do confess to Thee , Father , Lord of the heavens and of the earth , that thou didst hide these things from wise and understanding ones , and didst reveal them to babes . <EOV> <SOV> Yes , Father , because so it was good pleasure before Thee . <EOV> <SOV> ' All things were delivered to me by my Father , and none doth know the Son , except the Father , nor doth any know the Father , except the Son , and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal ' Him ' . <EOV> <SOV> ' Come unto me , all ye labouring and burdened ones , and I will give you rest , <EOV> <SOV> take up my yoke upon you , and learn from me , because I am meek and humble in heart , and ye shall find rest to your souls , <EOV> <SOV> for my yoke ' is ' easy , and my burden is light . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that time did Jesus go on the sabbaths through the corn , and his disciples were hungry , and they began to pluck ears , and to eat , <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees having seen , said to him , ' Lo , thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on a sabbath . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Did ye not read what David did , when he was hungry , himself and those with him -- <EOV> <SOV> how he went into the house of God , and the loaves of the presentation did eat , which it is not lawful to him to eat , nor to those with him , except to the priests alone ? <EOV> <SOV> ' Or did ye not read in the Law , that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple do profane the sabbath , and are blameless ? <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , that a greater than the temple is here ; <EOV> <SOV> and if ye had known what is : Kindness I will , and not sacrifice -- ye had not condemned the blameless , <EOV> <SOV> for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having departed thence , he went to their synagogue , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , there was a man having the hand withered , and they questioned him , saying , ' Is it lawful to heal on the sabbaths ? ' that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' What man shall be of you , who shall have one sheep , and if this may fall on the sabbaths into a ditch , will not lay hold on it and raise ' it ' ? <EOV> <SOV> How much better , therefore , is a man than a sheep ? -- so that it is lawful on the sabbaths to do good . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to the man , ' Stretch forth thy hand , ' and he stretched ' it ' forth , and it was restored whole as the other . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees having gone forth , held a consultation against him , how they might destroy him , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having known , withdrew thence , and there followed him great multitudes , and he healed them all , <EOV> <SOV> and did charge them that they might not make him manifest , <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Lo , My servant , whom I did choose , My beloved , in whom My soul did delight , I will put My Spirit upon him , and judgment to the nations he shall declare , <EOV> <SOV> he shall not strive nor cry , nor shall any hear in the broad places his voice , <EOV> <SOV> a bruised reed he shall not break , and smoking flax he shall not quench , till he may put forth judgment to victory , <EOV> <SOV> and in his name shall nations hope . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then was brought to him a demoniac , blind and dumb , and he healed him , so that the blind and dumb both spake and saw . <EOV> <SOV> And all the multitudes were amazed , and said , ' Is this the Son of David ? ' <EOV> <SOV> but the Pharisees having heard , said , ' This one doth not cast out demons , except by Beelzeboul , ruler of the demons . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said to them , ' Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated , and no city or house having been divided against itself , doth stand , <EOV> <SOV> and if the Adversary doth cast out the Adversary , against himself he was divided , how then doth his kingdom stand ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And if I , by Beelzeboul , do cast out the demons , your sons -- by whom do they cast out ? because of this they -- they shall be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> ' But if I , by the Spirit of God , do cast out the demons , then come already unto you did the reign of God . <EOV> <SOV> ' Or how is one able to go into the house of the strong man , and to plunder his goods , if first he may not bind the strong man ? and then his house he will plunder . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is not with me is against me , and he who is not gathering with me , doth scatter . <EOV> <SOV> Because of this I say to you , all sin and evil speaking shall be forgiven to men , but the evil speaking of the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever may speak a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven to him , but whoever may speak against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is coming . <EOV> <SOV> ' Either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree bad , and its fruit bad , for from the fruit is the tree known . <EOV> <SOV> ' Brood of vipers ! how are ye able to speak good things -- being evil ? for out of the abundance of the heart doth the mouth speak . <EOV> <SOV> The good man out of the good treasure of the heart doth put forth the good things , and the evil man out of the evil treasure doth put forth evil things . <EOV> <SOV> ' And I say to you , that every idle word that men may speak , they shall give for it a reckoning in a day of judgment ; <EOV> <SOV> for from thy words thou shalt be declared righteous , and from thy words thou shalt be declared unrighteous . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then answered certain of the scribes and Pharisees , saying , ' Teacher , we will to see a sign from thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , ' A generation , evil and adulterous , doth seek a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it , except the sign of Jonah the prophet ; <EOV> <SOV> for , as Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights , so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights . <EOV> <SOV> ' Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it , for they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah , and lo , a greater than Jonah here ! <EOV> <SOV> ' A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it , for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and lo , a greater than Solomon here ! <EOV> <SOV> ' And , when the unclean spirit may go forth from the man , it doth walk through dry places seeking rest , and doth not find ; <EOV> <SOV> then it saith , I will turn back to my house whence I came forth ; and having come , it findeth ' it ' unoccupied , swept , and adorned : <EOV> <SOV> then doth it go , and take with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself , and having gone in they dwell there , and the last of that man doth become worse than the first ; so shall it be also to this evil generation . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while he was yet speaking to the multitudes , lo , his mother and brethren had stood without , seeking to speak to him , <EOV> <SOV> and one said to him , ' Lo , thy mother and thy brethren do stand without , seeking to speak to thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to him who spake to him , ' Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And having stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , he said , ' Lo , my mother and my brethren ! <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may do the will of my Father who is in the heavens , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And in that day Jesus , having gone forth from the house , was sitting by the sea , <EOV> <SOV> and gathered together unto him were many multitudes , so that he having gone into the boat did sit down , and all the multitude on the beach did stand , <EOV> <SOV> and he spake to them many things in similes , saying : ' Lo , the sower went forth to sow , <EOV> <SOV> and in his sowing , some indeed fell by the way , and the fowls did come and devour them , <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the rocky places , where they had not much earth , and immediately they sprang forth , through not having depth of earth , <EOV> <SOV> and the sun having risen they were scorched , and through not having root , they withered , <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the thorns , and the thorns did come up and choke them , <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the good ground , and were giving fruit , some indeed a hundredfold , and some sixty , and some thirty . <EOV> <SOV> He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples having come near , said to him , ' Wherefore in similes dost thou speak to them ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them that -- ' To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of the heavens , and to these it hath not been given , <EOV> <SOV> for whoever hath , it shall be given to him , and he shall have overabundance , and whoever hath not , even that which he hath shall be taken from him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Because of this , in similes do I speak to them , because seeing they do not see , and hearing they do not hear , nor understand , <EOV> <SOV> and fulfilled on them is the prophecy of Isaiah , that saith , With hearing ye shall hear , and ye shall not understand , and seeing ye shall see , and ye shall not perceive , <EOV> <SOV> for made gross was the heart of this people , and with the ears they heard heavily , and their eyes they did close , lest they might see with the eyes , and with the ears might hear , and with the heart understand , and turn back , and I might heal them . <EOV> <SOV> ' And happy are your eyes because they see , and your ears because they hear , <EOV> <SOV> for verily I say to you , that many prophets and righteous men did desire to see that which ye look on , and they did not see , and to hear that which ye hear , and they did not hear . <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye , therefore , hear ye the simile of the sower : <EOV> <SOV> Every one hearing the word of the reign , and not understanding -- the evil one doth come , and doth catch that which hath been sown in his heart ; this is that sown by the way . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that sown on the rocky places , this is he who is hearing the word , and immediately with joy is receiving it , <EOV> <SOV> and he hath not root in himself , but is temporary , and persecution or tribulation having happened because of the word , immediately he is stumbled . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that sown toward the thorns , this is he who is hearing the word , and the anxiety of this age , and the deceitfulness of the riches , do choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that sown on the good ground : this is he who is hearing the word , and is understanding , who indeed doth bear fruit , and doth make , some indeed a hundredfold , and some sixty , and some thirty . ' <EOV> <SOV> Another simile he set before them , saying : ' The reign of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field , <EOV> <SOV> and , while men are sleeping , his enemy came and sowed darnel in the midst of the wheat , and went away , <EOV> <SOV> and when the herb sprang up , and yielded fruit , then appeared also the darnel . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the servants of the householder , having come near , said to him , Sir , good seed didst thou not sow in thy field ? whence then hath it the darnel ? <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , A man , an enemy , did this ; and the servants said to him , Wilt thou , then , ' that ' having gone away we may gather it up ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And he said , No , lest -- gathering up the darnel -- ye root up with it the wheat , <EOV> <SOV> suffer both to grow together till the harvest , and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather up first the darnel , and bind it in bundles , to burn it , and the wheat gather up into my storehouse . ' <EOV> <SOV> Another simile he set before them , saying : ' The reign of the heavens is like to a grain of mustard , which a man having taken , did sow in his field , <EOV> <SOV> which less , indeed , is than all the seeds , but when it may be grown , is greatest of the herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the heaven do come and rest in its branches . ' <EOV> <SOV> Another simile spake he to them : ' The reign of the heavens is like to leaven , which a woman having taken , hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . ' <EOV> <SOV> All these things spake Jesus in similes to the multitudes , and without a simile he was not speaking to them , <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet , saying , ' I will open in similes my mouth , I will utter things having been hidden from the foundation of the world . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then having let away the multitudes , Jesus came to the house , and his disciples came near to him , saying , ' Explain to us the simile of the darnel of the field . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , ' He who is sowing the good seed is the Son of Man , <EOV> <SOV> and the field is the world , and the good seed , these are the sons of the reign , and the darnel are the sons of the evil one , <EOV> <SOV> and the enemy who sowed them is the devil , and the harvest is a full end of the age , and the reapers are messengers . <EOV> <SOV> ' As , then , the darnel is gathered up , and is burned with fire , so shall it be in the full end of this age , <EOV> <SOV> the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers , and they shall gather up out of his kingdom all the stumbling - blocks , and those doing the unlawlessness , <EOV> <SOV> and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth . <EOV> <SOV> ' Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the reign of their Father . He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> ' Again , the reign of the heavens is like to treasure hid in the field , which a man having found did hide , and from his joy goeth , and all , as much as he hath , he selleth , and buyeth that field . <EOV> <SOV> ' Again , the reign of the heavens is like to a man , a merchant , seeking goodly pearls , <EOV> <SOV> who having found one pearl of great price , having gone away , hath sold all , as much as he had , and bought it . <EOV> <SOV> ' Again , the reign of the heavens is like to a net that was cast into the sea , and did gather together of every kind , <EOV> <SOV> which , when it was filled , having drawn up again upon the beach , and having sat down , they gathered the good into vessels , and the bad they did cast out , <EOV> <SOV> so shall it be in the full end of the age , the messengers shall come forth and separate the evil out of the midst of the righteous , <EOV> <SOV> and shall cast them to the furnace of the fire , there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , ' Did ye understand all these ? ' They say to him , ' Yes , sir . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Because of this every scribe having been discipled in regard to the reign of the heavens , is like to a man , a householder , who doth bring forth out of his treasure things new and old . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus finished these similes , he removed thence , <EOV> <SOV> and having come to his own country , he was teaching them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and were saying , ' Whence to this one this wisdom and the mighty works ? <EOV> <SOV> is not this the carpenter 's son ? is not his mother called Mary , and his brethren James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ? <EOV> <SOV> and his sisters -- are they not all with us ? whence , then , to this one all these ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were stumbled at him . And Jesus said to them , ' A prophet is not without honor except in his own country , and in his own house : ' <EOV> <SOV> and he did not there many mighty works , because of their unbelief . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that time did Herod the tetrarch hear the fame of Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> and said to his servants , ' This is John the Baptist , he did rise from the dead , and because of this the mighty energies are working in him . ' <EOV> <SOV> For Herod having laid hold on John , did bind him , and did put him in prison , because of Herodias his brother Philip 's wife , <EOV> <SOV> for John was saying to him , ' It is not lawful to thee to have her , ' <EOV> <SOV> and , willing to kill him , he feared the multitude , because as a prophet they were holding him . <EOV> <SOV> But the birthday of Herod being kept , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst , and did please Herod , <EOV> <SOV> whereupon with an oath he professed to give her whatever she might ask . <EOV> <SOV> And she having been instigated by her mother -- ' Give me ( says she ) here upon a plate the head of John the Baptist ; <EOV> <SOV> and the king was grieved , but because of the oaths and of those reclining with him , he commanded ' it ' to be given ; <EOV> <SOV> and having sent , he beheaded John in the prison , <EOV> <SOV> and his head was brought upon a plate , and was given to the damsel , and she brought ' it ' nigh to her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples having come , took up the body , and buried it , and having come , they told Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having heard , withdrew thence in a boat to a desolate place by himself , and the multitudes having heard did follow him on land from the cities . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having come forth , saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion upon them , and did heal their infirm ; <EOV> <SOV> and evening having come , his disciples came to him , saying , ' The place is desolate , and the hour hath now past , let away the multitudes that , having gone to the villages , they may buy to themselves food . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , ' They have no need to go away -- give ye them to eat . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they say to him , ' We have not here except five loaves , and two fishes . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' Bring ye them to me hither . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass , and having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , having looked up to the heaven , he did bless , and having broken , he gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes , <EOV> <SOV> and they did all eat , and were filled , and they took up what was over of the broken pieces twelve hand - baskets full ; <EOV> <SOV> and those eating were about five thousand men , apart from women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the boat , and to go before him to the other side , till he might let away the multitudes ; <EOV> <SOV> and having let away the multitudes , he went up to the mountain by himself to pray , and evening having come , he was there alone , <EOV> <SOV> and the boat was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves , for the wind was contrary . <EOV> <SOV> And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went away to them , walking upon the sea , <EOV> <SOV> and the disciples having seen him walking upon the sea , were troubled saying -- ' It is an apparition , ' and from the fear they cried out ; <EOV> <SOV> and immediately Jesus spake to them , saying , ' Be of good courage , I am ' he ' , be not afraid . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering him said , ' Sir , if it is thou , bid me come to thee upon the waters ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' Come ; ' and having gone down from the boat , Peter walked upon the waters to come unto Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> but seeing the wind vehement , he was afraid , and having begun to sink , he cried out , saying , ' Sir , save me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus , having stretched forth the hand , laid hold of him , and saith to him , ' Little faith ! for what didst thou waver ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they having gone to the boat the wind lulled , <EOV> <SOV> and those in the boat having come , did bow to him , saying , ' Truly -- God 's Son art thou . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having passed over , they came to the land of Gennesaret , <EOV> <SOV> and having recognized him , the men of that place sent forth to all that region round about , and they brought to him all who were ill , <EOV> <SOV> and were calling on him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment , and as many as did touch were saved . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then come unto Jesus do they from Jerusalem -- scribes and Pharisees -- saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Wherefore do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they do not wash their hands when they may eat bread . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , ' Wherefore also do ye transgress the command of God because of your tradition ? <EOV> <SOV> for God did command , saying , Honour thy father and mother ; and , He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death ; <EOV> <SOV> but ye say , Whoever may say to father or mother , An offering ' is ' whatever thou mayest be profited by me ; -- <EOV> <SOV> and he may not honour his father or his mother , and ye did set aside the command of God because of your tradition . <EOV> <SOV> ' Hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying , <EOV> <SOV> This people doth draw nigh to Me with their mouth , and with the lips it doth honour Me , but their heart is far off from Me ; <EOV> <SOV> and in vain do they worship Me , teaching teachings -- commands of men . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having called near the multitude , he said to them , ' Hear and understand : <EOV> <SOV> not that which is coming into the mouth doth defile the man , but that which is coming forth from the mouth , this defileth the man . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then his disciples having come near , said to him , ' Hast thou known that the Pharisees , having heard the word , were stumbled ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , ' Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant shall be rooted up ; <EOV> <SOV> let them alone , guides they are -- blind of blind ; and if blind may guide blind , both into a ditch shall fall . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering said to him , ' Explain to us this simile . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' Are ye also yet without understanding ? <EOV> <SOV> do ye not understand that all that is going into the mouth doth pass into the belly , and into the drain is cast forth ? <EOV> <SOV> but the things coming forth from the mouth from the heart do come forth , and these defile the man ; <EOV> <SOV> for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , whoredoms , thefts , false witnessings , evil speakings : <EOV> <SOV> these are the things defiling the man ; but to eat with unwashen hands doth not defile the man . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having come forth thence , withdrew to the parts of Tyre and Sidon , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a woman , a Canaanitess , from those borders having come forth , did call to him , saying , ' Deal kindly with me , Sir -- Son of David ; my daughter is miserably demonized . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he did not answer her a word ; and his disciples having come to him , were asking him , saying -- ' Let her away , because she crieth after us ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said , ' I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having come , she was bowing to him , saying , ' Sir , help me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said , ' It is not good to take the children 's bread , and to cast to the little dogs . ' <EOV> <SOV> And she said , ' Yes , sir , for even the little dogs do eat of the crumbs that are falling from their lords ' table ; ' <EOV> <SOV> then answering , Jesus said to her , ' O woman , great ' is ' thy faith , let it be to thee as thou wilt ; ' and her daughter was healed from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having passed thence , came nigh unto the sea of Galilee , and having gone up to the mountain , he was sitting there , <EOV> <SOV> and there came to him great multitudes , having with them lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and they did cast them at the feet of Jesus , and he healed them , <EOV> <SOV> so that the multitudes did wonder , seeing dumb ones speaking , maimed whole , lame walking , and blind seeing ; and they glorified the God of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having called near his disciples , said , ' I have compassion upon the multitude , because now three days they continue with me , and they have not what they may eat ; and to let them away fasting I will not , lest they faint in the way . ' <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples say to him , ' Whence to us , in a wilderness , so many loaves , as to fill so great a multitude ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to them , ' How many loaves have ye ? ' and they said , ' Seven , and a few little fishes . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground , <EOV> <SOV> and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes , having given thanks , he did break , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they did all eat , and were filled , and they took up what was over of the broken pieces seven baskets full , <EOV> <SOV> and those eating were four thousand men , apart from women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And having let away the multitudes , he went into the boat , and did come to the borders of Magdala . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the Pharisees and Sadducees having come , tempting , did question him , to shew to them a sign from the heaven , <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said to them , ' Evening having come , ye say , Fair weather , for the heaven is red , <EOV> <SOV> and at morning , Foul weather to - day , for the heaven is red -- gloomy ; hypocrites , the face of the heavens indeed ye do know to discern , but the signs of the times ye are not able ! <EOV> <SOV> ' A generation evil and adulterous doth seek a sign , and a sign shall not be given to it , except the sign of Jonah the prophet ; ' and having left them he went away . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples having come to the other side , forgot to take loaves , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to them , ' Beware , and take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were reasoning in themselves , saying , ' Because we took no loaves . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having known , said to them , ' Why reason ye in yourselves , ye of little faith , because ye took no loaves ? <EOV> <SOV> do ye not yet understand , nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many hand - baskets ye took up ? <EOV> <SOV> nor the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? <EOV> <SOV> how do ye not understand that I did not speak to you of bread -- to take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Then they understood that he did not say to take heed of the leaven of the bread , but of the teaching , of the Pharisees and Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having come to the parts of Cesarea Philippi , was asking his disciples , saying , ' Who do men say me to be -- the Son of Man ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said , ' Some , John the Baptist , and others , Elijah , and others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . ' <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , ' And ye -- who do ye say me to be ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and Simon Peter answering said , ' Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him , ' Happy art thou , Simon Bar - Jona , because flesh and blood did not reveal ' it ' to thee , but my Father who is in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' And I also say to thee , that thou art a rock , and upon this rock I will build my assembly , and gates of Hades shall not prevail against it ; <EOV> <SOV> and I will give to thee the keys of the reign of the heavens , and whatever thou mayest bind upon the earth shall be having been bound in the heavens , and whatever thou mayest loose upon the earth shall be having been loosed in the heavens . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then did he charge his disciples that they may say to no one that he is Jesus the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> From that time began Jesus to shew to his disciples that it is necessary for him to go away to Jerusalem , and to suffer many things from the elders , and chief priests , and scribes , and to be put to death , and the third day to rise . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken him aside , Peter began to rebuke him , saying , ' Be kind to thyself , sir ; this shall not be to thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he having turned , said to Peter , ' Get thee behind me , adversary ! thou art a stumbling - block to me , for thou dost not mind the things of God , but the things of men . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to his disciples , ' If any one doth will to come after me , let him disown himself , and take up his cross , and follow me , <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may will to save his life , shall lose it , and whoever may lose his life for my sake shall find it , <EOV> <SOV> for what is a man profited if he may gain the whole world , but of his life suffer loss ? or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life ? <EOV> <SOV> ' For , the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his Father , with his messengers , and then he will reward each , according to his work . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , there are certain of those standing here who shall not taste of death till they may see the Son of Man coming in his reign . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And after six days Jesus taketh Peter , and James , and John his brother , and doth bring them up to a high mount by themselves , <EOV> <SOV> and he was transfigured before them , and his face shone as the sun , and his garments did become white as the light , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , appear to them did Moses and Elijah , talking together with him . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering said to Jesus , ' Sir , it is good to us to be here ; if thou wilt , we may make here three booths -- for thee one , and for Moses one , and one for Elijah . ' <EOV> <SOV> While he is yet speaking , lo , a bright cloud overshadowed them , and lo , a voice out of the cloud , saying , ' This is My Son , -- the Beloved , in whom I did delight ; hear him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples having heard , did fall upon their face , and were exceedingly afraid , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having come near , touched them , and said , ' Rise , be not afraid , ' <EOV> <SOV> and having lifted up their eyes , they saw no one , except Jesus only . <EOV> <SOV> And as they are coming down from the mount , Jesus charged them , saying , ' Say to no one the vision , till the Son of Man out of the dead may rise . ' <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples questioned him , saying , ' Why then do the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' Elijah doth indeed come first , and shall restore all things , <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you -- Elijah did already come , and they did not know him , but did with him whatever they would , so also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then understood the disciples that concerning John the Baptist he spake to them . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came unto the multitude , there came to him a man , kneeling down to him , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , ' Sir , deal kindly with my son , for he is lunatic , and doth suffer miserably , for often he doth fall into the fire , and often into the water , <EOV> <SOV> and I brought him near to thy disciples , and they were not able to heal him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , ' O generation , unstedfast and perverse , till when shall I be with you ? till when shall I bear you ? bring him to me hither ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus rebuked him , and the demon went out of him , and the lad was healed from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples having come to Jesus by himself , said , ' Wherefore were we not able to cast him out ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , ' Through your want of faith ; for verily I say to you , if ye may have faith as a grain of mustard , ye shall say to this mount , Remove hence to yonder place , and it shall remove , and nothing shall be impossible to you , <EOV> <SOV> and this kind doth not go forth except in prayer and fasting . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while they are living in Galilee , Jesus said to them , ' The Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men , <EOV> <SOV> and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall rise , ' and they were exceeding sorry . <EOV> <SOV> And they having come to Capernaum , those receiving the didrachms came near to Peter , and said , ' Your teacher -- doth he not pay the didrachms ? ' He saith , ' Yes . ' <EOV> <SOV> And when he came into the house , Jesus anticipated him , saying , ' What thinkest thou , Simon ? the kings of the earth -- from whom do they receive custom or poll - tax ? from their sons or from the strangers ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith to him , ' From the strangers . ' Jesus said to him , ' Then are the sons free ; <EOV> <SOV> but , that we may not cause them to stumble , having gone to the sea , cast a hook , and the fish that hath come up first take thou up , and having opened its mouth , thou shalt find a stater , that having taken , give to them for me and thee . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that hour came the disciples near to Jesus , saying , ' Who , now , is greater in the reign of the heavens ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having called near a child , did set him in the midst of them , <EOV> <SOV> and said , ' Verily I say to you , if ye may not be turned and become as the children , ye may not enter into the reign of the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> whoever then may humble himself as this child , he is the greater in the reign of the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he who may receive one such child in my name , doth receive me , <EOV> <SOV> and whoever may cause to stumble one of those little ones who are believing in me , it is better for him that a weighty millstone may be hanged upon his neck , and he may be sunk in the depth of the sea . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to the world from the stumbling - blocks ! for there is a necessity for the stumbling - blocks to come , but wo to that man through whom the stumbling - block doth come ! <EOV> <SOV> ' And if thy hand or thy foot doth cause thee to stumble , cut them off and cast from thee ; it is good for thee to enter into the life lame or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet , to be cast to the fire the age - during . <EOV> <SOV> ' And if thine eye doth cause thee to stumble , pluck it out and cast from thee ; it is good for thee one - eyed to enter into the life , rather than having two eyes to be cast to the gehenna of the fire . <EOV> <SOV> ' Beware ! -- ye may not despise one of these little ones , for I say to you , that their messengers in the heavens do always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens , <EOV> <SOV> for the Son of Man did come to save the lost . <EOV> <SOV> ' What think ye ? if a man may have an hundred sheep , and there may go astray one of them , doth he not -- having left the ninety - nine , having gone on the mountains -- seek that which is gone astray ? <EOV> <SOV> and if it may come to pass that he doth find it , verily I say to you , that he doth rejoice over it more than over the ninety - nine that have not gone astray ; <EOV> <SOV> so it is not will in presence of your Father who is in the heavens , that one of these little ones may perish . <EOV> <SOV> ' And if thy brother may sin against thee , go and show him his fault between thee and him alone , if he may hear thee , thou didst gain thy brother ; <EOV> <SOV> and if he may not hear , take with thee yet one or two , that by the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may stand . <EOV> <SOV> ' And if he may not hear them , say ' it ' to the assembly , and if also the assembly he may not hear , let him be to thee as the heathen man and the tax - gatherer . <EOV> <SOV> ' Verily I say to you , Whatever things ye may bind upon the earth shall be having been bound in the heavens , and whatever things ye may loose on the earth shall be having been loosed in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' Again , I say to you , that , if two of you may agree on the earth concerning anything , whatever they may ask -- it shall be done to them from my Father who is in the heavens , <EOV> <SOV> for where there are two or three gathered together -- to my name , there am I in the midst of them . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter having come near to him , said , ' Sir , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him -- till seven times ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' I do not say to thee till seven times , but till seventy times seven . <EOV> <SOV> ' Because of this was the reign of the heavens likened to a man , a king , who did will to take reckoning with his servants , <EOV> <SOV> and he having begun to take account , there was brought near to him one debtor of a myriad of talents , <EOV> <SOV> and he having nothing to pay , his lord did command him to be sold , and his wife , and the children , and all , whatever he had , and payment to be made . <EOV> <SOV> The servant then , having fallen down , was bowing to him , saying , Sir , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all ; <EOV> <SOV> and the lord of that servant having been moved with compassion did release him , and the debt he forgave him . <EOV> <SOV> ' And , that servant having come forth , found one of his fellow - servants who was owing him an hundred denaries , and having laid hold , he took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that which thou owest . <EOV> <SOV> His fellow - servant then , having fallen down at his feet , was calling on him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all ; <EOV> <SOV> and he would not , but having gone away , he cast him into prison , till he might pay that which was owing . <EOV> <SOV> ' And his fellow - servants having seen the things that were done , were grieved exceedingly , and having come , shewed fully to their lord all the things that were done ; <EOV> <SOV> then having called him , his lord saith to him , Evil servant ! all that debt I did forgive thee , seeing thou didst call upon me , <EOV> <SOV> did it not behove also thee to have dealt kindly with thy fellow - servant , as I also dealt kindly with thee ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And having been wroth , his lord delivered him to the inquisitors , till he might pay all that was owing to him ; <EOV> <SOV> so also my heavenly Father will do to you , if ye may not forgive each one his brother from your hearts their trespasses . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus finished these words , he removed from Galilee , and did come to the borders of Judea , beyond the Jordan , <EOV> <SOV> and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them there . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees came near to him , tempting him , and saying to him , ' Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , ' Did ye not read , that He who made ' them ' , from the beginning a male and a female made them , <EOV> <SOV> and said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and cleave to his wife , and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh ? <EOV> <SOV> so that they are no more two , but one flesh ; what therefore God did join together , let no man put asunder . ' <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , ' Why then did Moses command to give a roll of divorce , and to put her away ? ' <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them -- ' Moses for your stiffness of heart did suffer you to put away your wives , but from the beginning it hath not been so . <EOV> <SOV> ' And I say to you , that , whoever may put away his wife , if not for whoredom , and may marry another , doth commit adultery ; and he who did marry her that hath been put away , doth commit adultery . ' <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say to him , ' If the case of the man with the woman is so , it is not good to marry . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' All do not receive this word , but those to whom it hath been given ; <EOV> <SOV> for there are eunuchs who from the mother 's womb were so born ; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men ; and there are eunuchs who kept themselves eunuchs because of the reign of the heavens : he who is able to receive ' it ' -- let him receive . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then were brought near to him children that he might put hands on them and pray , and the disciples rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , ' Suffer the children , and forbid them not , to come unto me , for of such is the reign of the heavens ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having laid on them ' his ' hands , he departed thence . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , one having come near , said to him , ' Good teacher , what good thing shall I do , that I may have life age - during ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , ' Why me dost thou call good ? no one ' is ' good except One -- God ; but if thou dost will to enter into the life , keep the commands . ' <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him , ' What kind ? ' And Jesus said , ' Thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not commit adultery , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not bear false witness , <EOV> <SOV> honour thy father and mother , and , thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . ' <EOV> <SOV> The young man saith to him , ' All these did I keep from my youth ; what yet do I lack ? ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , ' If thou dost will to be perfect , go away , sell what thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , follow me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the young man , having heard the word , went away sorrowful , for he had many possessions ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to his disciples , ' Verily I say to you , that hardly shall a rich man enter into the reign of the heavens ; <EOV> <SOV> and again I say to you , it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to go , than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples having heard , were amazed exceedingly , saying , ' Who , then , is able to be saved ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having earnestly beheld , said to them , ' With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter answering said to him , ' Lo , we did leave all , and follow thee , what then shall we have ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , ' Verily I say to you , that ye who did follow me , in the regeneration , when the Son of Man may sit upon a throne of his glory , shall sit -- ye also -- upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel ; <EOV> <SOV> and every one who left houses , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or fields , for my name 's sake , an hundredfold shall receive , and life age - during shall inherit ; <EOV> <SOV> and many first shall be last , and last first . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' For the reign of the heavens is like to a man , a householder , who went forth with the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard , <EOV> <SOV> and having agreed with the workmen for a denary a day , he sent them into his vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> ' And having gone forth about the third hour , he saw others standing in the market - place idle , <EOV> <SOV> and to these he said , Go ye -- also ye -- to the vineyard , and whatever may be righteous I will give you ; <EOV> <SOV> and they went away . ' Again , having gone forth about the sixth and the ninth hour , he did in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> And about the eleventh hour , having gone forth , he found others standing idle , and saith to them , Why here have ye stood all the day idle ? <EOV> <SOV> they say to him , Because no one did hire us ; he saith to them , Go ye -- ye also -- to the vineyard , and whatever may be righteous ye shall receive . <EOV> <SOV> ' And evening having come , the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward , Call the workmen , and pay them the reward , having begun from the last -- unto the first . <EOV> <SOV> And they of about the eleventh hour having come , did receive each a denary . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the first having come , did suppose that they shall receive more , and they received , they also , each a denary , <EOV> <SOV> and having received ' it ' , they were murmuring against the householder , saying , <EOV> <SOV> that These , the last , wrought one hour , and thou didst make them equal to us , who were bearing the burden of the day -- and the heat . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he answering said to one of them , Comrade , I do no unrighteousness to thee ; for a denary didst not thou agree with me ? <EOV> <SOV> take that which is thine , and go ; and I will to give to this , the last , also as to thee ; <EOV> <SOV> is it not lawful to me to do what I will in mine own ? is thine eye evil because I am good ? <EOV> <SOV> So the last shall be first , and the first last , for many are called , and few chosen . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus going up to Jerusalem , took the twelve disciples by themselves in the way , and said to them , <EOV> <SOV> ' Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes , <EOV> <SOV> and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the nations to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify , and the third day he will rise again . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then came near to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee , with her sons , bowing and asking something from him , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to her , ' What wilt thou ? ' She saith to him , ' Say , that they may sit -- these my two sons -- one on thy right hand , and one on the left , in thy reign . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , ' Ye have not known what ye ask for yourselves ; are ye able to drink of the cup that I am about to drink ? and with the baptism that I am baptized with , to be baptized ? ' They say to him , ' We are able . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , ' Of my cup indeed ye shall drink , and with the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized ; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give , but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared by my father . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the ten having heard , were much displeased with the two brothers , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having called them near , said , ' Ye have known that the rulers of the nations do exercise lordship over them , and those great do exercise authority over them , <EOV> <SOV> but not so shall it be among you , but whoever may will among you to become great , let him be your ministrant ; <EOV> <SOV> and whoever may will among you to be first , let him be your servant ; <EOV> <SOV> even as the Son of Man did not come to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they going forth from Jericho , there followed him a great multitude , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , two blind men sitting by the way , having heard that Jesus doth pass by , cried , saying , ' Deal kindly with us , sir -- Son of David . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude charged them that they might be silent , and they cried out the more , saying , ' Deal kindly with us sir -- Son of David . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having stood , Jesus called them , and said , ' What will ye ' that ' I may do to you ? ' <EOV> <SOV> they say to him , ' Sir , that our eyes may be opened ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having been moved with compassion , Jesus touched their eyes , and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , and came to Bethphage , unto the mount of the Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying to them , ' Go on to the village over - against you , and immediately ye shall find an ass bound , and a colt with her -- having loosed , bring ye to me ; <EOV> <SOV> and if any one may say anything to you , ye shall say , that the lord hath need of them , and immediately he will send them . ' <EOV> <SOV> And all this came to pass , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Tell ye the daughter of Zion , Lo , thy king doth come to thee , meek , and mounted on an ass , and a colt , a foal of a beast of burden . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples having gone and having done as Jesus commanded them , <EOV> <SOV> brought the ass and the colt , and did put on them their garments , and set ' him ' upon them ; <EOV> <SOV> and the very great multitude spread their own garments in the way , and others were cutting branches from the trees , and were strewing in the way , <EOV> <SOV> and the multitudes who were going before , and who were following , were crying , saying , ' Hosanna to the Son of David , blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he having entered into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , ' Who is this ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes said , ' This is Jesus the prophet , who ' is ' from Nazareth of Galilee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus entered into the temple of God , and did cast forth all those selling and buying in the temple , and the tables of the money - changers he overturned , and the seats of those selling the doves , <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' It hath been written , My house a house of prayer shall be called , but ye did make it a den of robbers . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there came to him blind and lame men in the temple , and he healed them , <EOV> <SOV> and the chief priests and the scribes having seen the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , ' Hosanna to the Son of David , ' were much displeased ; <EOV> <SOV> and they said to him , ' Hearest thou what these say ? ' And Jesus saith to them , ' Yes , did ye never read , that , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou didst prepare praise ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And having left them , he went forth out of the city to Bethany , and did lodge there , <EOV> <SOV> and in the morning turning back to the city , he hungered , <EOV> <SOV> and having seen a certain fig - tree on the way , he came to it , and found nothing in it except leaves only , and he saith to it , ' No more from thee may fruit be -- to the age ; ' and forthwith the fig - tree withered . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples having seen , did wonder , saying , ' How did the fig - tree forthwith wither ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' Verily I say to you , If ye may have faith , and may not doubt , not only this of the fig - tree shall ye do , but even if to this mount ye may say , Be lifted up and be cast into the sea , it shall come to pass ; <EOV> <SOV> and all -- as much as ye may ask in the prayer , believing , ye shall receive . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he having come to the temple , there came to him when teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people , saying , ' By what authority dost thou do these things ? and who gave thee this authority ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' I will ask you -- I also -- one word , which if ye may tell me , I also will tell you by what authority I do these things ; <EOV> <SOV> the baptism of John , whence was it ? -- from heaven , or from men ? ' And they were reasoning with themselves , saying , ' If we should say , From heaven ; he will say to us , Wherefore , then , did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> and if we should say , From men , we fear the multitude , for all hold John as a prophet . ' <EOV> <SOV> And answering Jesus they said , ' We have not known . ' He said to them -- he also -- ' Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> ' And what think ye ? A man had two children , and having come to the first , he said , Child , go , to - day be working in my vineyard . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , ' I will not , ' but at last , having repented , he went . <EOV> <SOV> ' And having come to the second , he said in the same manner , and he answering said , I ' go ' , sir , and went not ; <EOV> <SOV> which of the two did the will of the father ? ' They say to him , ' The first . ' Jesus saith to them , ' Verily I say to you , that the tax - gatherers and the harlots do go before you into the reign of God , <EOV> <SOV> for John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye did not believe him , and the tax - gatherers and the harlots did believe him , and ye , having seen , repented not at last -- to believe him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Hear ye another simile : There was a certain man , a householder , who planted a vineyard , and did put a hedge round it , and digged in it a wine - press , and built a tower , and gave it out to husbandmen , and went abroad . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when the season of the fruits came nigh , he sent his servants unto the husbandmen , to receive the fruits of it , <EOV> <SOV> and the husbandmen having taken his servants , one they scourged , and one they killed , and one they stoned . <EOV> <SOV> ' Again he sent other servants more than the first , and they did to them in the same manner . <EOV> <SOV> ' And at last he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son ; <EOV> <SOV> and the husbandmen having seen the son , said among themselves , This is the heir , come , we may kill him , and may possess his inheritance ; <EOV> <SOV> and having taken him , they cast ' him ' out of the vineyard , and killed him ; <EOV> <SOV> whenever therefore the lord of the vineyard may come , what will he do to these husbandmen ? ' <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , ' Evil men -- he will evilly destroy them , and the vineyard will give out to other husbandmen , who will give back to him the fruits in their seasons . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , ' Did ye never read in the Writings , A stone that the builders disallowed , it became head of a corner ; from the Lord hath this come to pass , and it is wonderful in our eyes . <EOV> <SOV> ' Because of this I say to you , that the reign of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth its fruit ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who is falling on this stone shall be broken , and on whomsoever it may fall it will crush him to pieces . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the Pharisees having heard his similes , knew that of them he speaketh , <EOV> <SOV> and seeking to lay hold on him , they feared the multitudes , seeing they were holding him as a prophet . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus answering , again spake to them in similes , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' The reign of the heavens was likened to a man , a king , who made marriage - feasts for his son , <EOV> <SOV> and he sent forth his servants to call those having been called to the marriage - feasts , and they were not willing to come . <EOV> <SOV> ' Again he sent forth other servants , saying , Say to those who have been called : Lo , my dinner I prepared , my oxen and the fatlings have been killed , and all things ' are ' ready , come ye to the marriage - feasts ; <EOV> <SOV> and they , having disregarded ' it ' , went away , the one to his own field , and the other to his merchandise ; <EOV> <SOV> and the rest , having laid hold on his servants , did insult and slay ' them ' . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the king having heard , was wroth , and having sent forth his soldiers , he destroyed those murderers , and their city he set on fire ; <EOV> <SOV> then saith he to his servants , The marriage - feast indeed is ready , and those called were not worthy , <EOV> <SOV> be going , then , on to the cross - ways , and as many as ye may find , call ye to the marriage - feasts . <EOV> <SOV> ' And those servants , having gone forth to the ways , did gather all , as many as they found , both bad and good , and the marriage - feast apartment was filled with those reclining . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the king having come in to view those reclining , saw there a man not clothed with clothing of the marriage - feast , <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to him , Comrade , how didst thou come in hither , not having clothing of the marriage - feast ? and he was speechless . <EOV> <SOV> ' Then said the king to the ministrants , Having bound his feet and hands , take him up and cast forth to the outer darkness , there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth ; <EOV> <SOV> for many are called , and few chosen . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then the Pharisees having gone , took counsel how they might ensnare him in words , <EOV> <SOV> and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , ' Teacher , we have known that thou art true , and the way of God in truth thou dost teach , and thou art not caring for any one , for thou dost not look to the face of men ; <EOV> <SOV> tell us , therefore , what dost thou think ? is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having known their wickedness , said , ' Why me do ye tempt , hypocrites ? <EOV> <SOV> show me the tribute - coin ? ' and they brought to him a denary ; <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' Whose ' is ' this image and the inscription ? ' <EOV> <SOV> they say to him , ' Caesar 's ; ' then saith he to them , ' Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar , and the things of God to God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having heard they wondered , and having left him they went away . <EOV> <SOV> In that day there came near to him Sadducees , who are saying there is not a rising again , and they questioned him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Teacher , Moses said , If any one may die not having children , his brother shall marry his wife , and shall raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> ' And there were with us seven brothers , and the first having married did die , and not having seed , he left his wife to his brother ; <EOV> <SOV> in like manner also the second , and the third , unto the seventh , <EOV> <SOV> and last of all died also the woman ; <EOV> <SOV> therefore in the rising again , of which of the seven shall she be wife -- for all had her ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' Ye go astray , not knowing the Writings , nor the power of God ; <EOV> <SOV> for in the rising again they do not marry , nor are they given in marriage , but are as messengers of God in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> ' And concerning the rising again of the dead , did ye not read that which was spoken to you by God , saying , <EOV> <SOV> I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not a God of dead men , but of living . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having heard , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching ; <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees , having heard that he did silence the Sadducees , were gathered together unto him ; <EOV> <SOV> and one of them , a lawyer , did question , tempting him , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Teacher , which ' is ' the great command in the Law ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , ' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thine understanding -- <EOV> <SOV> this is a first and great command ; <EOV> <SOV> and the second ' is ' like to it , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ; <EOV> <SOV> on these -- the two commands -- all the law and the prophets do hang . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees having been gathered together , Jesus did question them , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' What do ye think concerning the Christ ? of whom is he son ? ' They say to him , ' Of David . ' <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , ' How then doth David in the Spirit call him lord , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The Lord said to my lord , Sit at my right hand , till I may make thine enemies thy footstool ? <EOV> <SOV> If then David doth call him lord , how is he his son ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And no one was able to answer him a word , nor durst any from that day question him any more . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Jesus spake to the multitudes , and to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' On the seat of Moses sat down the scribes and the Pharisees ; <EOV> <SOV> all , then , as much as they may say to you to observe , observe and do , but according to their works do not , for they say , and do not ; <EOV> <SOV> for they bind together burdens heavy and grievous to be borne , and lay upon the shoulders of men , but with their finger they will not move them . <EOV> <SOV> ' And all their works they do to be seen by men , and they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the fringes of their garments , <EOV> <SOV> they love also the chief couches in the supper , and the chief seats in the synagogues , <EOV> <SOV> and the salutations in the market - places , and to be called by men , Rabbi , Rabbi . <EOV> <SOV> ' And ye -- ye may not be called Rabbi , for one is your director -- the Christ , and all ye are brethren ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye may not call ' any ' your father on the earth , for one is your Father , who is in the heavens , <EOV> <SOV> nor may ye be called directors , for one is your director -- the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And the greater of you shall be your ministrant , <EOV> <SOV> and whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled , and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye shut up the reign of the heavens before men , for ye do not go in , nor those going in do ye suffer to enter . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye eat up the houses of the widows , and for a pretence make long prayers , because of this ye shall receive more abundant judgment . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye go round the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte , and whenever it may happen -- ye make him a son of gehenna twofold more than yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , blind guides , who are saying , Whoever may swear by the sanctuary , it is nothing , but whoever may swear by the gold of the sanctuary -- is debtor ! <EOV> <SOV> Fools and blind ! for which ' is ' greater , the gold , or the sanctuary that is sanctifying the gold ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And , whoever may swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever may swear by the gift that is upon it -- is debtor ! <EOV> <SOV> Fools and blind ! for which ' is ' greater , the gift , or the altar that is sanctifying the gift ? <EOV> <SOV> ' He therefore who did swear by the altar , doth swear by it , and by all things on it ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who did swear by the sanctuary , doth swear by it , and by Him who is dwelling in it ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who did swear by the heaven , doth swear by the throne of God , and by Him who is sitting upon it . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye give tithe of the mint , and the dill , and the cumin , and did neglect the weightier things of the Law -- the judgment , and the kindness , and the faith ; these it behoved ' you ' to do , and those not to neglect . <EOV> <SOV> ' Blind guides ! who are straining out the gnat , and the camel are swallowing . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye make clean the outside of the cup and the plate , and within they are full of rapine and incontinence . <EOV> <SOV> ' Blind Pharisee ! cleanse first the inside of the cup and the plate , that the outside of them also may become clean . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye are like to whitewashed sepulchres , which outwardly indeed do appear beautiful , and within are full of bones of dead men , and of all uncleanness ; <EOV> <SOV> so also ye outwardly indeed do appear to men righteous , and within ye are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and adorn the tombs of the righteous , <EOV> <SOV> and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> So that ye testify to yourselves , that ye are sons of them who did murder the prophets ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye -- ye fill up the measure of your fathers . <EOV> <SOV> ' Serpents ! brood of vipers ! how may ye escape from the judgment of the gehenna ? <EOV> <SOV> ' Because of this , lo , I send to you prophets , and wise men , and scribes , and of them ye will kill and crucify , and of them ye will scourge in your synagogues , and will pursue from city to city ; <EOV> <SOV> that on you may come all the righteous blood being poured out on the earth from the blood of Abel the righteous , unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar : <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to you , all these things shall come upon this generation . <EOV> <SOV> ' Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that art killing the prophets , and stoning those sent unto thee , how often did I will to gather thy children together , as a hen doth gather her own chickens under the wings , and ye did not will . <EOV> <SOV> Lo , left desolate to you is your house ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , ye may not see me henceforth , till ye may say , Blessed ' is ' he who is coming in the name of the Lord . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having gone forth , Jesus departed from the temple , and his disciples came near to show him the buildings of the temple , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to them , ' Do ye not see all these ? verily I say to you , There may not be left here a stone upon a stone , that shall not be thrown down . ' <EOV> <SOV> And when he is sitting on the mount of the Olives , the disciples came near to him by himself , saying , ' Tell us , when shall these be ? and what ' is ' the sign of thy presence , and of the full end of the age ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' Take heed that no one may lead you astray , <EOV> <SOV> for many shall come in my name , saying , I am the Christ , and they shall lead many astray , <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall begin to hear of wars , and reports of wars ; see , be not troubled , for it behoveth all ' these ' to come to pass , but the end is not yet . <EOV> <SOV> ' For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places ; <EOV> <SOV> and all these ' are ' the beginning of sorrows ; <EOV> <SOV> then they shall deliver you up to tribulation , and shall kill you , and ye shall be hated by all the nations because of my name ; <EOV> <SOV> and then shall many be stumbled , and they shall deliver up one another , and shall hate one another . <EOV> <SOV> ' And many false prophets shall arise , and shall lead many astray ; <EOV> <SOV> and because of the abounding of the lawlessness , the love of the many shall become cold ; <EOV> <SOV> but he who did endure to the end , he shall be saved ; <EOV> <SOV> and this good news of the reign shall be proclaimed in all the world , for a testimony to all the nations ; and then shall the end arrive . <EOV> <SOV> ' Whenever , therefore , ye may see the abomination of the desolation , that was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( whoever is reading let him observe ) <EOV> <SOV> then those in Judea -- let them flee to the mounts ; <EOV> <SOV> he on the house - top -- let him not come down to take up any thing out of his house ; <EOV> <SOV> and he in the field -- let him not turn back to take his garments . <EOV> <SOV> ' And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck in those days ; <EOV> <SOV> and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter , nor on a sabbath ; <EOV> <SOV> for there shall be then great tribulation , such as was not from the beginning of the world till now , no , nor may be . <EOV> <SOV> And if those days were not shortened , no flesh would have been saved ; but because of the chosen , shall those days be shortened . <EOV> <SOV> ' Then if any one may say to you , Lo , here ' is ' the Christ ! or here ! ye may not believe ; <EOV> <SOV> for there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and they shall give great signs and wonders , so as to lead astray , if possible , also the chosen . <EOV> <SOV> Lo , I did tell you beforehand . <EOV> <SOV> ' If therefore they may say to you , Lo , in the wilderness he is , ye may not go forth ; lo , in the inner chambers , ye may not believe ; <EOV> <SOV> for as the lightning doth come forth from the east , and doth appear unto the west , so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man ; <EOV> <SOV> for wherever the carcase may be , there shall the eagles be gathered together . <EOV> <SOV> ' And immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from the heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken ; <EOV> <SOV> and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven ; and then shall all the tribes of the earth smite the breast , and they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of the heaven , with power and much glory ; <EOV> <SOV> and he shall send his messengers with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds , from the ends of the heavens unto the ends thereof . <EOV> <SOV> ' And from the fig - tree learn ye the simile : When already its branch may have become tender , and the leaves it may put forth , ye know that summer ' is ' nigh , <EOV> <SOV> so also ye , when ye may see all these , ye know that it is nigh -- at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , this generation may not pass away till all these may come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> The heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> ' And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers of the heavens -- except my Father only ; <EOV> <SOV> and as the days of Noah -- so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man ; <EOV> <SOV> for as they were , in the days before the flood , eating , and drinking , marrying , and giving in marriage , till the day Noah entered into the ark , <EOV> <SOV> and they did not know till the flood came and took all away ; so shall be also the presence of the Son of Man . <EOV> <SOV> Then two men shall be in the field , the one is received , and the one is left ; <EOV> <SOV> two women shall be grinding in the mill , one is received , and one is left . <EOV> <SOV> ' Watch ye therefore , because ye have not known in what hour your Lord doth come ; <EOV> <SOV> and this know , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief doth come , he had watched , and not suffered his house to be broken through ; <EOV> <SOV> because of this also ye , become ye ready , because in what hour ye do not think , the Son of Man doth come . <EOV> <SOV> ' Who , then , is the servant , faithful and wise , whom his lord did set over his household , to give them the nourishment in season ? <EOV> <SOV> Happy that servant , whom his lord , having come , shall find doing so ; <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to you , that over all his substance he will set him . <EOV> <SOV> ' And , if that evil servant may say in his heart , My Lord doth delay to come , <EOV> <SOV> and may begin to beat the fellow - servants , and to eat and to drink with the drunken , <EOV> <SOV> the lord of that servant will arrive in a day when he doth not expect , and in an hour of which he doth not know , <EOV> <SOV> and will cut him off , and his portion with the hypocrites will appoint ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> ' Then shall the reign of the heavens be likened to ten virgins , who , having taken their lamps , went forth to meet the bridegroom ; <EOV> <SOV> and five of them were prudent , and five foolish ; <EOV> <SOV> they who were foolish having taken their lamps , did not take with themselves oil ; <EOV> <SOV> and the prudent took oil in their vessels , with their lamps . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the bridegroom tarrying , they all nodded and were sleeping , <EOV> <SOV> and in the middle of the night a cry was made , Lo , the bridegroom doth come ; go ye forth to meet him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Then rose all those virgins , and trimmed their lamps , <EOV> <SOV> and the foolish said to the prudent , Give us of your oil , because our lamps are going out ; <EOV> <SOV> and the prudent answered , saying -- Lest there may not be sufficient for us and you , go ye rather unto those selling , and buy for yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> ' And while they are going away to buy , the bridegroom came , and those ready went in with him to the marriage - feasts , and the door was shut ; <EOV> <SOV> and afterwards come also do the rest of the virgins , saying , Sir , sir , open to us ; <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said , Verily I say to you , I have not known you . <EOV> <SOV> ' Watch therefore , for ye have not known the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man doth come . <EOV> <SOV> ' For -- as a man going abroad did call his own servants , and did deliver to them his substance , <EOV> <SOV> and to one he gave five talents , and to another two , and to another one , to each according to his several ability , went abroad immediately . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he who did receive the five talents , having gone , wrought with them , and made other five talents ; <EOV> <SOV> in like manner also he who ' received ' the two , he gained , also he , other two ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who did receive the one , having gone away , digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money . <EOV> <SOV> ' And after a long time cometh the lord of those servants , and taketh reckoning with them ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who did receive the five talents having come , brought other five talents , saying , ' Sir , five talents thou didst deliver to me ; lo , other five talents did I gain besides them . <EOV> <SOV> ' And his lord said to him , Well done , servant , good and faithful , over a few things thou wast faithful , over many things I will set thee ; enter into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he who also did receive the two talents having come , said , Sir , two talents thou didst deliver to me ; lo , other two talents I did gain besides them . <EOV> <SOV> ' His lord said to him , Well done , servant , good and faithful , over a few things thou wast faithful , over many things I will set thee ; enter into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he also who hath received the one talent having come , said , Sir , I knew thee , that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou didst not sow , and gathering from whence thou didst not scatter ; <EOV> <SOV> and having been afraid , having gone away , I hid thy talent in the earth ; lo , thou hast thine own ! <EOV> <SOV> ' And his lord answering said to him , Evil servant , and slothful , thou hadst known that I reap where I did not sow , and I gather whence I did not scatter ! <EOV> <SOV> it behoved thee then to put my money to the money - lenders , and having come I had received mine own with increase . <EOV> <SOV> ' Take therefore from him the talent , and give to him having the ten talents , <EOV> <SOV> for to every one having shall be given , and he shall have overabundance , and from him who is not having , even that which he hath shall be taken from him ; <EOV> <SOV> and the unprofitable servant cast ye forth to the outer darkness ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth . <EOV> <SOV> ' And whenever the Son of Man may come in his glory , and all the holy messengers with him , then he shall sit upon a throne of his glory ; <EOV> <SOV> and gathered together before him shall be all the nations , and he shall separate them from one another , as the shepherd doth separate the sheep from the goats , <EOV> <SOV> and he shall set the sheep indeed on his right hand , and the goats on the left . <EOV> <SOV> ' Then shall the king say to those on his right hand , Come ye , the blessed of my Father , inherit the reign that hath been prepared for you from the foundation of the world ; <EOV> <SOV> for I did hunger , and ye gave me to eat ; I did thirst , and ye gave me to drink ; I was a stranger , and ye received me ; <EOV> <SOV> naked , and ye put around me ; I was infirm , and ye looked after me ; in prison I was , and ye came unto me . <EOV> <SOV> ' Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when did we see thee hungering , and we nourished ? or thirsting , and we gave to drink ? <EOV> <SOV> and when did we see thee a stranger , and we received ? or naked , and we put around ? <EOV> <SOV> and when did we see thee infirm , or in prison , and we came unto thee ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And the king answering , shall say to them , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye did ' it ' to one of these my brethren -- the least -- to me ye did ' it ' . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall he say also to those on the left hand , Go ye from me , the cursed , to the fire , the age - during , that hath been prepared for the Devil and his messengers ; <EOV> <SOV> for I did hunger , and ye gave me not to eat ; I did thirst , and ye gave me not to drink ; <EOV> <SOV> a stranger I was , and ye did not receive me ; naked , and ye put not around me ; infirm , and in prison , and ye did not look after me . <EOV> <SOV> ' Then shall they answer , they also , saying , Lord , when did we see thee hungering , or thirsting , or a stranger , or naked , or infirm , or in prison , and we did not minister to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> ' Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye did ' it ' not to one of these , the least , ye did ' it ' not to me . <EOV> <SOV> And these shall go away to punishment age - during , but the righteous to life age - during . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus finished all these words , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> ' Ye have known that after two days the passover cometh , and the Son of Man is delivered up to be crucified . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then were gathered together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , to the court of the chief priest who was called Caiaphas ; <EOV> <SOV> and they consulted together that they might take Jesus by guile , and kill ' him ' , <EOV> <SOV> and they said , ' Not in the feast , that there may not be a tumult among the people . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having been in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , <EOV> <SOV> there came to him a woman having an alabaster box of ointment , very precious , and she poured on his head as he is reclining ( at meat ) . <EOV> <SOV> And having seen ' it ' , his disciples were much displeased , saying , ' To what purpose ' is ' this waste ? <EOV> <SOV> for this ointment could have been sold for much , and given to the poor . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having known , said to them , ' Why do ye give trouble to the woman ? for a good work she wrought for me ; <EOV> <SOV> for the poor always ye have with you , and me ye have not always ; <EOV> <SOV> for she having put this ointment on my body -- for my burial she did ' it ' . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world , what this ' one ' did shall also be spoken of -- for a memorial of her . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then one of the twelve , who is called Judas Iscariot , having gone unto the chief priests , said , <EOV> <SOV> ' What are ye willing to give me , and I will deliver him up to you ? ' and they weighed out to him thirty silverlings , <EOV> <SOV> and from that time he was seeking a convenient season to deliver him up . <EOV> <SOV> And on the first ' day ' of the unleavened food came the disciples near to Jesus , saying to him , ' Where wilt thou ' that ' we may prepare for thee to eat the passover ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' Go away to the city , unto such a one , and say to him , The Teacher saith , My time is nigh ; near thee I keep the passover , with my disciples ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and the disciples did as Jesus appointed them , and prepared the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And evening having come , he was reclining ( at meat ) with the twelve , <EOV> <SOV> and while they are eating , he said , ' Verily I say to you , that one of you shall deliver me up . ' <EOV> <SOV> And being grieved exceedingly , they began to say to him , each of them , ' Is it I , Sir ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , ' He who did dip with me the hand in the dish , he will deliver me up ; <EOV> <SOV> the Son of Man doth indeed go , as it hath been written concerning him , but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up ! good it were for him if that man had not been born . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Judas -- he who delivered him up -- answering said , ' Is it I , Rabbi ? ' He saith to him , ' Thou hast said . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while they were eating , Jesus having taken the bread , and having blessed , did brake , and was giving to the disciples , and said , ' Take , eat , this is my body ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having taken the cup , and having given thanks , he gave to them , saying , ' Drink ye of it -- all ; <EOV> <SOV> for this is my blood of the new covenant , that for many is being poured out -- to remission of sins ; <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , that I may not drink henceforth on this produce of the vine , till that day when I may drink it with you new in the reign of my Father . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having sung a hymn , they went forth to the mount of the Olives ; <EOV> <SOV> then saith Jesus to them , ' All ye shall be stumbled at me this night ; for it hath been written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad ; <EOV> <SOV> but , after my having risen , I will go before you to Galilee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering said to him , ' Even if all shall be stumbled at thee , I will never be stumbled . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , ' Verily I say to thee , that , this night , before cock - crowing , thrice thou wilt deny me . ' <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith to him , ' Even if it may be necessary for me to die with thee , I will not deny thee ; ' in like manner also said all the disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Then come with them doth Jesus to a place called Gethsemane , and he saith to the disciples , ' Sit ye here , till having gone away , I shall pray yonder . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having taken Peter , and the two sons of Zebedee , he began to be sorrowful , and to be very heavy ; <EOV> <SOV> then saith he to them , ' Exceedingly sorrowful is my soul -- unto death ; abide ye here , and watch with me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having gone forward a little , he fell on his face , praying , and saying , ' My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me ; nevertheless , not as I will , but as Thou . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them sleeping , and he saith to Peter , ' So ! ye were not able one hour to watch with me ! <EOV> <SOV> watch , and pray , that ye may not enter into temptation : the spirit indeed is forward , but the flesh weak . ' <EOV> <SOV> Again , a second time , having gone away , he prayed , saying , ' My Father , if this cup can not pass away from me except I drink it , Thy will be done ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having come , he findeth them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy . <EOV> <SOV> And having left them , having gone away again , he prayed a third time , saying the same word ; <EOV> <SOV> then cometh he unto his disciples , and saith to them , ' Sleep on henceforth , and rest ! lo , the hour hath come nigh , and the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Rise , let us go ; lo , he hath come nigh who is delivering me up . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while he is yet speaking , lo , Judas , one of the twelve did come , and with him a great multitude , with swords and sticks , from the chief priests and elders of the people . <EOV> <SOV> And he who did deliver him up did give them a sign , saying , ' Whomsoever I will kiss , it is he : lay hold on him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately , having come to Jesus , he said , ' Hail , Rabbi , ' and kissed him ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to him , ' Comrade , for what art thou present ? ' Then having come near , they laid hands on Jesus , and took hold on him . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , one of those with Jesus , having stretched forth the hand , drew his sword , and having struck the servant of the chief priest , he took off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus to him , ' Turn back thy sword to its place ; for all who did take the sword , by the sword shall perish ; <EOV> <SOV> dost thou think that I am not able now to call upon my Father , and He will place beside me more than twelve legions of messengers ? <EOV> <SOV> how then may the Writings be fulfilled , that thus it behoveth to happen ? ' <EOV> <SOV> In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes , ' As against a robber ye did come forth , with swords and sticks , to take me ! daily with you I was sitting teaching in the temple , and ye did not lay hold on me ; <EOV> <SOV> but all this hath come to pass , that the Writings of the prophets may be fulfilled ; ' then all the disciples , having left him , fled . <EOV> <SOV> And those laying hold on Jesus led ' him ' away unto Caiaphas the chief priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together , <EOV> <SOV> and Peter was following him afar off , unto the court of the chief priest , and having gone in within , he was sitting with the officers , to see the end . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests , and the elders , and all the council , were seeking false witness against Jesus , that they might put him to death , <EOV> <SOV> and they did not find ; and many false witnesses having come near , they did not find ; and at last two false witnesses having come near , <EOV> <SOV> said , ' This one said , I am able to throw down the sanctuary of God , and after three days to build it . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priest having stood up , said to him , ' Nothing thou dost answer ! what do these witness against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus was silent . And the chief priest answering said to him , ' I adjure thee , by the living God , that thou mayest say to us , if thou art the Christ -- the Son of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , ' Thou hast said ; nevertheless I say to you , hereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power , and coming upon the clouds , of the heaven . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then the chief priest rent his garments , saying , -- ' He hath spoken evil ; what need have we yet of witnesses ? lo , now ye heard his evil speaking ; <EOV> <SOV> what think ye ? ' and they answering said , ' He is worthy of death . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then did they spit in his face and buffet him , and others did slap , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Declare to us , O Christ , who he is that struck thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter without was sitting in the court , and there came near to him a certain maid , saying , ' And thou wast with Jesus of Galilee ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And he denied before all , saying , ' I have not known what thou sayest . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he having gone forth to the porch , another female saw him , and saith to those there , ' And this one was with Jesus of Nazareth ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and again did he deny with an oath -- ' I have not known the man . ' <EOV> <SOV> And after a little those standing near having come , said to Peter , ' Truly thou also art of them , for even thy speech doth make thee manifest . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then began he to anathematise , and to swear -- ' I have not known the man ; ' and immediately did a cock crow , <EOV> <SOV> and Peter remembered the saying of Jesus , he having said to him -- ' Before cock - crowing , thrice thou wilt deny me ; ' and having gone without , he did weep bitterly . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And morning having come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus , so as to put him to death ; <EOV> <SOV> and having bound him , they did lead away , and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate , the governor . <EOV> <SOV> Then Judas -- he who delivered him up -- having seen that he was condemned , having repented , brought back the thirty silverlings to the chief priests , and to the elders , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' I did sin , having delivered up innocent blood ; ' and they said , ' What -- to us ? thou shalt see ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary , he departed , and having gone away , he did strangle himself . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests having taken the silverlings , said , ' It is not lawful to put them to the treasury , seeing it is the price of blood ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having taken counsel , they bought with them the field of the potter , for the burial of strangers ; <EOV> <SOV> therefore was that field called , ' Field of blood , ' unto this day . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet , saying , ' And I took the thirty silverlings , the price of him who hath been priced , whom they of the sons of Israel did price , <EOV> <SOV> and gave them for the field of the potter , as the Lord did appoint to me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood before the governor , and the governor did question him , saying , ' Art thou the king of the Jews ! ' And Jesus said to him , ' Thou sayest . ' <EOV> <SOV> And in his being accused by the chief priests and the elders , he did not answer any thing , <EOV> <SOV> then saith Pilate to him , ' Dost thou not hear how many things they witness against thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he did not answer him , not even to one word , so that the governor did wonder greatly . <EOV> <SOV> And at the feast the governor had been accustomed to release one to the multitude , a prisoner , whom they willed , <EOV> <SOV> and they had then a noted prisoner , called Barabbas , <EOV> <SOV> they therefore having been gathered together , Pilate said to them , ' Whom will ye I shall release to you ? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ ? ' <EOV> <SOV> for he had known that because of envy they had delivered him up . <EOV> <SOV> And as he is sitting on the tribunal , his wife sent unto him , saying , ' Nothing -- to thee and to that righteous one , for many things did I suffer to - day in a dream because of him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas , and might destroy Jesus ; <EOV> <SOV> and the governor answering said to them , ' Which of the two will ye ' that ' I shall release to you ? ' And they said , ' Barabbas . ' <EOV> <SOV> Pilate saith to them , ' What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ ? ' They all say to him , ' Let be crucified ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And the governor said , ' Why , what evil did he ? ' and they were crying out the more , saying , ' Let be crucified . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate having seen that it profiteth nothing , but rather a tumult is made , having taken water , he did wash the hands before the multitude , saying , ' I am innocent from the blood of this righteous one ; ye -- ye shall see ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and all the people answering said , ' His blood ' is ' upon us , and upon our children ! ' <EOV> <SOV> Then did he release to them Barabbas , and having scourged Jesus , he delivered ' him ' up that he may be crucified ; <EOV> <SOV> then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to the Praetorium , did gather to him all the band ; <EOV> <SOV> and having unclothed him , they put around him a crimson cloak , <EOV> <SOV> and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put ' it ' on his head , and a reed in his right hand , and having kneeled before him , they were mocking him , saying , ' Hail , the king of the Jews . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having spit on him , they took the reed , and were smiting on his head ; <EOV> <SOV> and when they had mocked him , they took off from him the cloak , and put on him his own garments , and led him away to crucify ' him ' . <EOV> <SOV> And coming forth , they found a man , a Cyrenian , by name Simon : him they impressed that he might bear his cross ; <EOV> <SOV> and having come to a place called Golgotha , that is called Place of a Skull , <EOV> <SOV> they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall , and having tasted , he would not drink . <EOV> <SOV> And having crucified him , they divided his garments , casting a lot , that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet , ' They divided my garments to themselves , and over my vesture they cast a lot ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and sitting down , they were watching him there , <EOV> <SOV> and they put up over his head , his accusation written , ' This is Jesus , the king of the Jews . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then crucified with him are two robbers , one on the right hand , and one on the left , <EOV> <SOV> and those passing by were speaking evil of him , wagging their heads , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , ' Thou that art throwing down the sanctuary , and in three days building ' it ' , save thyself ; if Son thou art of God , come down from the cross . ' <EOV> <SOV> And in like manner also the chief priests mocking , with the scribes and elders , said , <EOV> <SOV> ' Others he saved ; himself he is not able to save ! If he be King of Israel , let him come down now from the cross , and we will believe him ; <EOV> <SOV> he hath trusted on God , let Him now deliver him , if He wish him , because he said -- Son of God I am ; ' <EOV> <SOV> with the same also the robbers , who were crucified with him , were reproaching him . <EOV> <SOV> And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land unto the ninth hour , <EOV> <SOV> and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great voice , saying , ' Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? ' that is , ' My God , my God , why didst Thou forsake me ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And certain of those standing there having heard , said -- ' Elijah he doth call ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately , one of them having run , and having taken a spunge , having filled ' it ' with vinegar , and having put ' it ' on a reed , was giving him to drink , <EOV> <SOV> but the rest said , ' Let alone , let us see if Elijah doth come -- about to save him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having again cried with a great voice , yielded the spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> and lo , the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top unto bottom , and the earth did quake , and the rocks were rent , <EOV> <SOV> and the tombs were opened , and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep , arose , <EOV> <SOV> and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising , they went into the holy city , and appeared to many . <EOV> <SOV> And the centurion , and those with him watching Jesus , having seen the earthquake , and the things that were done , were exceedingly afraid , saying , ' Truly this was God 's Son . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there were there many women beholding from afar , who did follow Jesus from Galilee , ministering to him , <EOV> <SOV> among whom was Mary the Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and of Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee . <EOV> <SOV> And evening having come , there came a rich man , from Arimathea , named Joseph , who also himself was discipled to Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> he having gone near to Pilate , asked for himself the body of Jesus ; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken the body , Joseph wrapped it in clean linen , <EOV> <SOV> and laid it in his new tomb , that he hewed in the rock , and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , he went away ; <EOV> <SOV> and there were there Mary the Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over - against the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow that is after the preparation , were gathered together the chief priests , and the Pharisees , unto Pilate , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Sir , we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living , After three days I do rise ; <EOV> <SOV> command , then , the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day , lest his disciples , having come by night , may steal him away , and may say to the people , He rose from the dead , and the last deceit shall be worse than the first . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said to them , ' Ye have a watch , go away , make secure -- as ye have known ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they , having gone , did make the sepulchre secure , having sealed the stone , together with the watch . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And on the eve of the sabbaths , at the dawn , toward the first of the sabbaths , came Mary the Magdalene , and the other Mary , to see the sepulchre , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , there came a great earthquake , for a messenger of the Lord , having come down out of heaven , having come , did roll away the stone from the door , and was sitting upon it , <EOV> <SOV> and his countenance was as lightning , and his clothing white as snow , <EOV> <SOV> and from the fear of him did the keepers shake , and they became as dead men . <EOV> <SOV> And the messenger answering said to the women , ' Fear not ye , for I have known that Jesus , who hath been crucified , ye seek ; <EOV> <SOV> he is not here , for he rose , as he said ; come , see the place where the Lord was lying ; <EOV> <SOV> and having gone quickly , say ye to his disciples , that he rose from the dead ; and lo , he doth go before you to Galilee , there ye shall see him ; lo , I have told you . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having gone forth quickly from the tomb , with fear and great joy , they ran to tell to his disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> and as they were going to tell to his disciples , then lo , Jesus met them , saying , ' Hail ! ' and they having come near , laid hold of his feet , and did bow to him . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus to them , ' Fear ye not , go away , tell to my brethren that they may go away to Galilee , and there they shall see me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while they are going on , lo , certain of the watch having come to the city , told to the chief priests all the things that happened , <EOV> <SOV> and having been gathered together with the elders , counsel also having taken , they gave much money to the soldiers , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Say ye , that his disciples having come by night , stole him -- we being asleep ; <EOV> <SOV> and if this be heard by the governor , we will persuade him , and you keep free from anxiety . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they , having received the money , did as they were taught , and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this day . <EOV> <SOV> And the eleven disciples went to Galilee , to the mount where Jesus appointed them , <EOV> <SOV> and having seen him , they bowed to him , but some did waver . <EOV> <SOV> And having come near , Jesus spake to them , saying , ' Given to me was all authority in heaven and on earth ; <EOV> <SOV> having gone , then , disciple all the nations , ( baptizing them -- to the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit , <EOV> <SOV> teaching them to observe all , whatever I did command you , ) and lo , I am with you all the days -- till the full end of the age .
