<SOC> <SOV> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God ; <EOV> <SOV> As it is written in the prophets , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee ; <EOV> <SOV> The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . <EOV> <SOV> John was baptizing in the wilderness , and preaching the baptism of repentance , for the remission of sins . <EOV> <SOV> And there went out to him all the land of Judea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> And John was clothed with camels hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he ate locusts and wild honey ; <EOV> <SOV> And preached , saying , There cometh after me one mightier than I , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose . <EOV> <SOV> I indeed have baptized you with water : but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth to Galilee , and was baptized by John in Jordan . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness . <EOV> <SOV> And he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan : and was with the wild beasts , and the angels ministered to him . <EOV> <SOV> Now after John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel . <EOV> <SOV> Now as he was walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately they forsook their nets , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had gone a little further thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the boat mending their nets . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him . <EOV> <SOV> And they went into Capernaum ; and immediately on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes . <EOV> <SOV> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region around Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And forthwith , when they had come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John . <EOV> <SOV> But the mother of Simon 's wife lay sick with a fever ; and forthwith they tell him of her . <EOV> <SOV> And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered to them . <EOV> <SOV> And at evening , when the sun had set , they brought to him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with demons . <EOV> <SOV> And all the city was gathered at the door . <EOV> <SOV> And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases , and cast out many demons ; and suffered not the demons to speak , because they knew him . <EOV> <SOV> And in the morning , rising a great while before day , he went out and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon , and they that were with him , followed after him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had found him , they said to him , All men seek for thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for , for this purpose have I come . <EOV> <SOV> And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying to him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith to him , I will ; be thou clean . <EOV> <SOV> And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And he strictly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ; <EOV> <SOV> And saith to him , See thou say nothing to any man ; but go , show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . <EOV> <SOV> But he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And again he entered into Capernaum , after some days ; and it was understood that he was in the house . <EOV> <SOV> And forthwith many were assembled , so that there was no room to receive them , no not so much as about the door : and he preached the word to them . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to him , bringing one sick with the palsy , who was borne by four . <EOV> <SOV> And when they could not come nigh to him by reason of the crowd , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed on which the sick with the palsy lay . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the sick with the palsy , Son , thy sins are forgiven thee . <EOV> <SOV> But there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts , <EOV> <SOV> Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but God only ? <EOV> <SOV> And immediately , when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said to them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Which is easier , to say to the sick with the palsy , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , he saith to the sick with the palsy , <EOV> <SOV> I say to thee , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go into thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion . <EOV> <SOV> And he went forth again by the sea - side ; and all the multitude resorted to him , and he taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alpheus , sitting at the receipt of custom , and said to him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that as Jesus sat at table in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples ; for there were many , and they followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eating with publicans and sinners , they said to his disciples , How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus heard it , he saith to them , They that are in health , have no need of a physician , but they that are sick ; I came not to call the righteous , but sinners , to repentance . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John , and of the Pharisees , used to fast : and they come , and say to him , Why do the disciples of John , and of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Can the children of the bride - chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast . <EOV> <SOV> But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then they will fast in those days . <EOV> <SOV> No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up , taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse . <EOV> <SOV> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles , else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that he went through the corn - fields on the sabbath ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees said to him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath that which is not lawful ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was hungry , he and they that were with him ? <EOV> <SOV> How he went into the house of God , in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and ate the show - bread , which it is not lawful to eat , but for the priests , and gave also to them who were with him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , The sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath : <EOV> <SOV> Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there who had a withered hand . <EOV> <SOV> And they watched him , to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath ; that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to the man who had the withered hand , Stand forth . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? but they held their peace . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had looked around on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith to the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees went forth , and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judea . <EOV> <SOV> And from Jerusalem , and from Idumea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke to his disciples , that a small boat should wait on him , because of the multitude , lest they should throng him . <EOV> <SOV> For he had healed many ; so that they pressed upon him to touch him , as many as had diseases . <EOV> <SOV> And unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he strictly charged them , that they should not make him known . <EOV> <SOV> And he goeth up upon a mountain , and calleth to him whom he would : and they came to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach , <EOV> <SOV> And to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon he surnamed Peter . <EOV> <SOV> And James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James , ( and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , Sons of thunder , ) <EOV> <SOV> And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alpheus , and Thaddeus , and Simon the Canaanite , <EOV> <SOV> And Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him : and they went into a house . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread . <EOV> <SOV> And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem , said , He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of the demons he casteth out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And he called them to him , and said to them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ? <EOV> <SOV> And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand . <EOV> <SOV> And if a house be divided against itself , that house can not stand . <EOV> <SOV> And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he can not stand , but hath an end . <EOV> <SOV> No man can enter into a strong man 's house , and seize his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will plunder his house . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , All sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men , and any blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme : <EOV> <SOV> But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never hath forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation : <EOV> <SOV> Because they said , He hath an unclean spirit . <EOV> <SOV> There came then his brethren and his mother , and standing without , they sent to him , calling him . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude sat about him , and they said to him , Behold , thy mother , and thy brethren without seek for thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother , or my brethren ? <EOV> <SOV> And he looked around on them who sat about him , and said , Behold , my mother and my brethren ! <EOV> <SOV> For whoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he began again to teach by the sea - side : and there was gathered to him a great multitude , so that he entered into a boat , and sat on the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea , on the land . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught them many things by parables , and said to them in his doctrine , <EOV> <SOV> Hearken ; Behold , a sower went out to sow : <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass as he sowed , some fell by the way - side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it . <EOV> <SOV> And some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth . <EOV> <SOV> But when the sun had risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away . <EOV> <SOV> And some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell on good ground , and yielded fruit that sprang up , and increased , and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some a hundred . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was alone , they that were about him , with the twelve , asked of him the parable . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but to them that are without , all these things are done in parables : <EOV> <SOV> That seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ? <EOV> <SOV> The sower soweth the word . <EOV> <SOV> And these are they by the way - side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts . <EOV> <SOV> And these are they likewise who are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ; <EOV> <SOV> And have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word 's sake , immediately they relapse . <EOV> <SOV> And these are they who are sown among thorns ; such as hear the word , <EOV> <SOV> And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> And these are they who are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirty - fold , some sixty , and some a hundred . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Is a candle brought to be put under a close vessel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ? <EOV> <SOV> For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither hath any thing been kept secret , but that it should come abroad . <EOV> <SOV> If any man hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take heed what ye hear : With the measure which ye give , it shall be measured to you : and to you that hear shall more be given . <EOV> <SOV> For he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ; <EOV> <SOV> And should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how . <EOV> <SOV> For the earth bringeth forth fruit of itself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear . <EOV> <SOV> But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , To what shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like a grain of mustard - seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that are in the earth . <EOV> <SOV> But when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under its shade . <EOV> <SOV> And with many such parables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it . <EOV> <SOV> But without a parable he spoke not to them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the same day , when the evening was come , he saith to them , Let us pass over to the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the boat . And there were also with him other small boats . <EOV> <SOV> And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the boat , so that it was now full . <EOV> <SOV> And he was in the hinder part of the boat , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say to him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ? <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , Peace , be still : and the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And they came over to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come out of the boat , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit , <EOV> <SOV> Who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains : <EOV> <SOV> For he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him . <EOV> <SOV> And always , night and day , he was on the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshiped him , <EOV> <SOV> And cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the Most High God ? I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not . <EOV> <SOV> ( For he said to him , Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit . ) <EOV> <SOV> And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he answered , saying , My name is Legion : for we are many . <EOV> <SOV> And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was there nigh to the mountains a great herd of swine feeding . <EOV> <SOV> And all the demons besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them . <EOV> <SOV> And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea ( they were about two thousand ) and were choked in the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that was done . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the demon , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And they that saw it told them how it befell him that was possessed with the demon , and also concerning the swine . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to pray him to depart out of their borders . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come into the boat , he that had been possessed with the demon prayed him that he might be with him . <EOV> <SOV> Yet Jesus suffered him not , but saith to him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him . And all men wondered . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had passed over again in a boat to the other side , much people gathered to him : and he was nigh to the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet , <EOV> <SOV> And besought him greatly , saying , My little daughter lieth at the point of death : I pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she will live . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went with him ; and many people followed him , and thronged him . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain woman who had an issue of blood twelve years , <EOV> <SOV> And had suffered many things from many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was not relieved , but rather grew worse , <EOV> <SOV> When she had heard of Jesus , came in the crowd behind , and touched his garment . <EOV> <SOV> For she said , If I may touch but his clothes , I shall be whole . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that infirmity . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the throng , and said , Who touched my clothes ? <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples said to him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ? <EOV> <SOV> And he looked around , to see her that had done this thing . <EOV> <SOV> But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be healed of thy infirmity . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking , there came from the ruler of the synagogue 's house certain who said , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ? <EOV> <SOV> As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith to the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe , <EOV> <SOV> And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come in , he saith to them , Why make ye this tumult , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they derided him : but when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the damsel by the hand , and said to her , Talitha cumi : which is , being interpreted , Damsel ( I say to thee ) arise . <EOV> <SOV> And forthwith the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them strictly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he went out from thence , and came into his own country , and his disciples follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the sabbath was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astonished , saying , From whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given to him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ? <EOV> <SOV> Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joses , and of Judas , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended at him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honor , but in his own country , and among his own kindred , and in his own house . <EOV> <SOV> And he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick persons , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And he marveled because of their unbelief . And he went around the villages teaching . <EOV> <SOV> And he calleth to him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ; <EOV> <SOV> And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no bag , no bread , no money in their purse : <EOV> <SOV> But be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , In whatever place ye enter into a house , there abide till ye depart from that place . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet , for a testimony against them . Verily I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out and preached that men should repent . <EOV> <SOV> And they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And king Herod heard of him ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist had risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him . <EOV> <SOV> Others said , That it is Elijah . And others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But when Herod heard of him , he said , It is John , whom I beheaded : he hath risen from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her . <EOV> <SOV> For John had said to Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not : <EOV> <SOV> For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just and holy man , and observed him : and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly . <EOV> <SOV> And when a convenient day had come , that Herod on his birth - day made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief men of Galilee ; <EOV> <SOV> And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod , and them that sat with him , the king said to the damsel , Ask of me whatever thou wilt , and I will give it thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he swore to her , Whatever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , to the half of my kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And she went forth , and said to her mother , What shall I ask ? and she said , The head of John the Baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And she came in forthwith with haste to the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou shouldst give me , immediately , in a dish , the head of John the Baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And the king was exceeding sorry : yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes who sat with him , he would not reject her . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison , <EOV> <SOV> And brought his head in a dish , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles assembled themselves to Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed into a desert place in a boat privately . <EOV> <SOV> And the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran on foot thither out of all cities , and out went them , and came together to him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , when he came out , saw many people , and was moved with compassion towards them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things . <EOV> <SOV> And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came to him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed : <EOV> <SOV> Send them away , that they may go into the country around , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat . <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said to them , Give ye them to eat . And they say to him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass . <EOV> <SOV> And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had taken the five loaves , and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and broke the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes he divided among them all . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate , and were satisfied . <EOV> <SOV> And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And they that ate of the loaves , were about five thousand men . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he constrained his disciples to get into the boat , and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida , while he sent away the people . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had dismissed them , he departed to a mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And when evening was come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land . <EOV> <SOV> And he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary to them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them . <EOV> <SOV> But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out . <EOV> <SOV> ( For they all saw him , and were troubled . ) And immediately he talked with them , and saith to them , Be of good cheer : It is I ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And he went up to them into the boat ; and the wind ceased : and they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered . <EOV> <SOV> For they considered not the miracle of the loaves ; for their heart was hardened . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come out of the boat forthwith they knew him , <EOV> <SOV> And ran through that whole region around , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was . <EOV> <SOV> And whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch , if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him , were healed . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then came together to him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , who came from Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled ( that is to say with unwashed ) hands , they found fault . <EOV> <SOV> For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands often eat not , holding the tradition of the elders . <EOV> <SOV> And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . And many other things there are , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , and of brazen vessels , and tables . <EOV> <SOV> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashed hands ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said to them , Well hath Isaiah prophesied concerning you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoreth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me . <EOV> <SOV> But , in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men . <EOV> <SOV> For laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Full well ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your own tradition , <EOV> <SOV> For Moses said , Honor thy father and thy mother ; and , Whoever curseth father or mother , let him die the death : <EOV> <SOV> But ye say , If a man shall say to his father or mother , It is Corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatever thou mightest be profited by me ; he shall be free . <EOV> <SOV> And ye suffer him no more to do aught for his father or his mother ; <EOV> <SOV> Making the word of God of no effect through your traditions , which ye have delivered : and many such like things ye do . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had called all the people to him , he said to them , Hearken to me every one of you , and understand . <EOV> <SOV> There is nothing from without a man , that entering into him , can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> If any man hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Are ye so void of understanding also ? Do ye not perceive , that whatever thing from without entereth into the man , it can not defile him . <EOV> <SOV> Because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all kinds of food . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , That which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man . <EOV> <SOV> For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders , <EOV> <SOV> Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness ; <EOV> <SOV> All these evil things come from within , and defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> And from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into a house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid . <EOV> <SOV> For a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet : <EOV> <SOV> ( The woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation , ) and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to her , Let the children first be satisfied : for it is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it to the dogs . <EOV> <SOV> And she answered and said to him , Yes , Lord : yet the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crums . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , For this saying , depart ; the demon is gone out of thy daughter . <EOV> <SOV> And when she had come to her house , she found the demon had gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed . <EOV> <SOV> And again , departing from the borders of Tyre and Sidon , he came to the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the borders of Decapolis . <EOV> <SOV> And they bring to him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue . <EOV> <SOV> And looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith to him , Effatha , that is , Be opened . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spoke plain . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them ; so much the more a great deal they published it ; <EOV> <SOV> And were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well ; he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In those days the multitude being very great , and having nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples , and saith to them , <EOV> <SOV> I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat : <EOV> <SOV> And if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for some of them came from a distance . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples answered him , From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ? <EOV> <SOV> And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and broke , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they set them before the people . <EOV> <SOV> And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them . <EOV> <SOV> So they ate , and were satisfied : and they took up of the fragments that were left , seven baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he dismissed them . <EOV> <SOV> And forthwith he entered into a boat with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking from him a sign from heaven , tempting him . <EOV> <SOV> And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek for a sign ? Verily I say to you , There shall no sign be given to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And he left them , and entering into the boat again , departed to the other side . <EOV> <SOV> Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the boat with them more than one loaf . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus knew it , he saith to them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ? <EOV> <SOV> Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ? <EOV> <SOV> When I divided the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say to him , Twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? And they said , Seven . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , How is it that ye do not understand ? <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh to Bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man to him , and besought him to touch him . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw aught . <EOV> <SOV> And he looked up , and said , I see men as trees walking . <EOV> <SOV> After that , he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Cesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying to them , Who do men say that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And they answered , John the Baptist : but some say , Elijah ; and others , One of the prophets , <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , But who say ye that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith to him , Thou art the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , and the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke that saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him . <EOV> <SOV> But when he had turned about , and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savorest not the things that are of God , but the things that are of men . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had called the people to him with his disciples also , he said to them , Whoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whoever will save his life , shall lose it ; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's , the same shall save it . <EOV> <SOV> For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul : <EOV> <SOV> Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul ? <EOV> <SOV> Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me , and of my words , in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also will the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said to them , Verily I say to you , that there are some of them that stand here who shall not taste death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power . <EOV> <SOV> And after six days , Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up upon a high mountain apart by themselves ; and he was transfigured before them . <EOV> <SOV> And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared to them Elijah , with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> For he knew not what to say : for they were greatly terrified . <EOV> <SOV> And there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly , when they had looked around , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , Why say the scribes that Elijah must first come ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and told them , Elijah verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written concerning the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at naught . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that Elijah is indeed come , and they have done to him whatever they pleased , as it is written concerning him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him , saluted him . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked the scribes , What question ye with them ? <EOV> <SOV> And one of the multitude answered and said , Master , I have brought to thee my son , who hath a dumb spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> And wherever he taketh him , he teareth him ; and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away ; and I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast him out , and they could not . <EOV> <SOV> He answered him , and saith , O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you , how long shall I suffer you ? bring him to me . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought him to him : and when he saw him , immediately the spirit tore him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed , foaming . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked his father , How long is it since this came to him ? and he said , From a child . <EOV> <SOV> And often it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , If thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , Lord , I believe ; help thou my unbelief . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying to him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him . <EOV> <SOV> And the spirit cried , and rent him severely , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; so that many said , He is dead . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it . <EOV> <SOV> For he taught his disciples , and said to them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they will kill him ; and after that he is killed , he will rise the third day . <EOV> <SOV> But they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Capernaum : and being in the house , he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ? <EOV> <SOV> But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith to them , If any man desireth to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all . <EOV> <SOV> And he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said to them , <EOV> <SOV> Whoever shall receive one of such children in my name , receiveth me : and whoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And John answered him , saying , Master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name , and he followeth not us ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not us . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Forbid him not ; for there is no man who shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me . <EOV> <SOV> For he that is not against us , is on our part . <EOV> <SOV> For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say to you , he shall not lose his reward . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe in me , to fall into sin , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy hand causeth thee to fall into sin , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched : <EOV> <SOV> Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy foot causeth thee to fall into sin , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched : <EOV> <SOV> Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy eye causeth thee to fall into sin , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes , to be cast into hell - fire . <EOV> <SOV> Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . <EOV> <SOV> For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt . <EOV> <SOV> Salt is good : but if the salt hath lost its saltness , with what will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he arose from thence , and cometh into the borders of Judea , by the further side of Jordan : and the people resort to him again ; and , as he was accustomed , he taught them again . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said to them , What did Moses command you ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to them , For the hardness of your heart , he wrote you this precept . <EOV> <SOV> But from the beginning of the creation , God made them male and female . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ; <EOV> <SOV> And they two shall be one flesh : so then they are no more two , but one flesh . <EOV> <SOV> What therefore God hath joined together , let not man separate . <EOV> <SOV> And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Whoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her . <EOV> <SOV> And if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them ; and his disciples rebuked those that brought them . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said to them , Suffer the little children to come to me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God , as a little child , he shall not enter it . <EOV> <SOV> And he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good , but one , that is God . <EOV> <SOV> Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honor thy father and mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said to him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus beholding him loved him , and said to him , One thing thou lackest : go , sell whatever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven ; and come , take up the cross , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus looked around , and saith to his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith to them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished beyond measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus looking upon them , saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter began to say to him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said , Verily I say to you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel 's , <EOV> <SOV> But he shall receive a hundred - fold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come , eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first . <EOV> <SOV> And they were in the way , going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen to him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man will be delivered to the chief priests , and to the scribes ; and they will condemn him to death , and will deliver him to the Gentiles ; <EOV> <SOV> And they will mock him , and will scourge him , and will spit upon him , and will kill him : and the third day he will rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And James and John the sons of Zebedee come to him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What would ye that I should do for you ? <EOV> <SOV> They said to him , Grant to us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , We can . And Jesus said to them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of : and with the baptism that I am baptized with shalt ye be baptized ; <EOV> <SOV> But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand , is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared . <EOV> <SOV> And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus called them , and saith to them , Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles , exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them . <EOV> <SOV> But so it shall not be among you : but whoever will be great among you , shall be your minister : <EOV> <SOV> And whoever of you will be the chief , shall be servant of all . <EOV> <SOV> For even the son of man came not to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples , and a great number of people , blind Bartimeus , the son of Timeus , sat by the highway - side begging . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called : and they call the blind man , saying to him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to him , What wilt thou that I should do to thee ? The blind man said to him , Lord , that I may receive my sight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Go , thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , to Bethphage , and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> And saith to them , Go into the village over against you : and as soon as ye have entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , on which never man sat ; loose him , and bring him . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man shall say to you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him ; and immediately he will send him hither . <EOV> <SOV> And they went , and found the colt tied by the door without , in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of them that stood there , said to them , What do ye , loosing the colt ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded ; and they let them go . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off trees , and strewed them in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed be the kingdom of our Father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round upon all things , it being now evening , he went out to Bethany , with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow , when they had come from Bethany , he was hungry , <EOV> <SOV> And seeing a fig - tree afar off , having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing on it : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves : for the time of figs had not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to it , Let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . And his disciples heard it . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money - changers , and the seats of them that sold doves ; <EOV> <SOV> And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught , saying to them , Is it not written , My house shall be called by all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people were astonished at his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> And when evening had come , he went out of the city . <EOV> <SOV> And in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig - tree dried up from the roots . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter calling to remembrance , saith to him , Master , behold , the fig - tree which thou cursedst is withered . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , saith to them , Have faith in God . <EOV> <SOV> For verily I say to you , that whoever shall say to this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that the things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatever he saith . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I say to you , Whatever things ye desire when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have aught against any : that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses . <EOV> <SOV> And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders , <EOV> <SOV> And say to him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? answer me . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> But if we shall say , from men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered and said to Jesus , We can not tell . And Jesus answering saith to them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he began to speak to them by parables . A certain man planted a vineyard , and set a hedge about it , and digged a place for the wine - vat , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country . <EOV> <SOV> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And they caught him , and beat him and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again , he sent to them another servant : and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some . <EOV> <SOV> Having yet therefore one son , his well - beloved , he sent him also last to them , saying , They will reverence my son . <EOV> <SOV> But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours . <EOV> <SOV> And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> What therefore will the Lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . <EOV> <SOV> And have ye not read this scripture ; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner : <EOV> <SOV> This was the Lord 's doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people ; for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and departed . <EOV> <SOV> And they sent to him certain of the Pharisees , and of the Herodians , to catch him in his words . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come , they say to him , Master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of God in truth : Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought it : and he saith to them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said to him , Cesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said to them , Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . And they wondered at him . <EOV> <SOV> Then come to him the Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Master , Moses wrote to us , If a man 's brother shall die , and leave his wife , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were seven brothers : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed . <EOV> <SOV> And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also . <EOV> <SOV> In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her for a wife . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said to them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ? <EOV> <SOV> For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels who are in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And concerning the dead that they rise ; have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spoke to him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment . <EOV> <SOV> And the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself : there is no other commandment greater than these . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribe said to him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God ; and there is no other but he . <EOV> <SOV> And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more than all whole burnt - offerings and sacrifices . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said to him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> For David himself said by the Holy Spirit , The LORD said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thy enemies thy footstool . <EOV> <SOV> David therefore himself calleth him Lord , and whence is he then his son ? and the common people heard him gladly . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , who love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the market - places , <EOV> <SOV> And the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts : <EOV> <SOV> Who devour widows ' houses , and for a pretense make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing . <EOV> <SOV> And he called his disciples , and saith to them , Verily I say to you , that this poor widow hath cast in more , than all they who have cast into the treasury . <EOV> <SOV> For all they cast in of their abundance : but she of her want cast in all that she had , even all her living . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as he was going out of the temple , one of his disciples saith to him , Master , see what manner of stones , and what buildings are here ! <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , over against the temple , Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , asked him privately , <EOV> <SOV> Tell us , when will these things be ? and what will be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering them , began to say , Take heed lest any man deceive you : <EOV> <SOV> For many will come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and will deceive many . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye shall hear of wars , and rumors of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end will not be yet . <EOV> <SOV> For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there will be earthquakes in divers places , and there will be famines , and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows . <EOV> <SOV> But take heed to yourselves : for they will deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye will be beaten : and ye will be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them . <EOV> <SOV> And the gospel must first be published among all nations . <EOV> <SOV> But when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Now the brother will betray the brother to death , and the father the son : and children will rise up against their parents , and will cause them to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will be hated by all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall endure to the end , the same shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand ) then let them that are in Judea flee to the mountains : <EOV> <SOV> And let him that is on the house - top not go down into the house , neither enter it , to take any thing out of his house : <EOV> <SOV> And let him that is in the field not turn back again to take up his garment . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to them that are with child , and to them that nurse infants in those days . <EOV> <SOV> And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter . <EOV> <SOV> For in those days shall be affliction , such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time , neither shall be . <EOV> <SOV> And except the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh would be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days . <EOV> <SOV> And then , if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ ; or lo , he is there ; believe him not . <EOV> <SOV> For false Christs , and false prophets will rise , and will show signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect . <EOV> <SOV> But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things . <EOV> <SOV> But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , <EOV> <SOV> And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> And then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory . <EOV> <SOV> And then he will send his angels , and will assemble his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Now learn a parable of the fig - tree : When its branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near : <EOV> <SOV> So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things shall be done . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is . <EOV> <SOV> For the son of man is as a man taking a long journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work ; and commanded the porter to watch . <EOV> <SOV> Watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at evening , or at midnight , or at the cock - crowing , or in the morning : <EOV> <SOV> Lest coming suddenly , he should find you sleeping . <EOV> <SOV> And what I say to you , I say to all , Watch . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests , and the scribes , sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> But they said , Not on the feast - day , lest there should be an uproar of the people . <EOV> <SOV> And being in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at table , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard , very precious ; and she broke the box , and poured it on his head . <EOV> <SOV> And there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , Why was this waste of the ointment made ? <EOV> <SOV> For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me . <EOV> <SOV> For ye have the poor with you always , and whenever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> She hath done what she could : she is come beforehand to anoint my body to the burying . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of , for a memorial of her . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went to the chief priests , to betray him to them . <EOV> <SOV> And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray him . <EOV> <SOV> And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said to him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare , that thou mayest eat the passover ? <EOV> <SOV> And he sendeth two of his disciples , and saith to them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And wherever he shall go in , say ye to the master of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guest - chamber , where I may eat the passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples went , and came into the city , and found as he had said to them : and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And in the evening he cometh with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And as they sat , and were eating , Jesus said , Verily I say to you , One of you who eateth with me , will betray me . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to be sorrowful , and to say to him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said to them , It is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written concerning him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and broke it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to them , All ye will be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered . <EOV> <SOV> But after that I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter said to him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I. <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to him , Verily I say to thee , that this day , even in this night , before the cock shall crow twice , thou wilt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> But he spoke the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray . <EOV> <SOV> And he taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and began to be greatly amazed , and to be very heavy ; <EOV> <SOV> And saith to them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful to death : tarry ye here , and watch . <EOV> <SOV> And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , If it were possible , the hour might pass from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible to thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless , not what I will , but what thou wilt . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith to Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldst not thou watch one hour ? <EOV> <SOV> Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak . <EOV> <SOV> And again he went away , and prayed , and spoke the same words . <EOV> <SOV> And when he returned , he found them asleep again ( for their eyes were heavy : ) neither knew they what to answer him . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh the third time , and saith to them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Rise , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately while he was yet speaking , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs , from the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders . <EOV> <SOV> And he that betrayed him , had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely . <EOV> <SOV> And as soon as he was come , he goeth immediately to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And they laid their hands on him , and took him . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to them , Have ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staffs to take me ? <EOV> <SOV> I was daily with you in the temple , teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And they all forsook him , and fled . <EOV> <SOV> And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him . <EOV> <SOV> And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked . <EOV> <SOV> And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests , and the elders and the scribes . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter followed him at a distance , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests , and all the council sought for testimony against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none . <EOV> <SOV> For many bore false testimony against him , but their testimony agreed not together . <EOV> <SOV> And there arose certain , and bore false testimony against him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands . <EOV> <SOV> But neither so did their testimony agree together . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these testify against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and said to him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death . <EOV> <SOV> And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say to him , Prophesy : and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands . <EOV> <SOV> And as Peter was below in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest : <EOV> <SOV> And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied , saying , I know not , neither do I understand what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch ; and the cock crowed . <EOV> <SOV> And a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them . <EOV> <SOV> And he denied it again . And a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilean , and thy speech agreeth thereto . <EOV> <SOV> But he began to curse and to swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak . <EOV> <SOV> And the second time the cock crowed . And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said to him , Before the cock shall crow twice , thou wilt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And forthwith in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes , and the whole council , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answering , said to him , Thou sayest it . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they testify against thee . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus yet answered nothing : so that Pilate marveled . <EOV> <SOV> Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner , whom they desired . <EOV> <SOV> And there was one named Barabbas , who lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude crying aloud , began to desire him to do as he had ever done to them . <EOV> <SOV> But Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> ( For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy . ) <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release Barabbas to them . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate answered , and said again to them , What will ye then that I shall do to him whom ye call the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> And they cried out again , Crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> Then Pilate said to them , Why , what evil hath he done ? And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas to them , and having scourged Jesus , delivered him to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Pretorium ; and they call together the whole band ; <EOV> <SOV> And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head , <EOV> <SOV> And began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews ! <EOV> <SOV> And they struck him on the head with a reed , and spit upon him , and bowing their knees , worshiped him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And they constrain one Simon , a Cyrenian , who was passing by , coming from the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross . <EOV> <SOV> And they bring him to the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull . <EOV> <SOV> And they gave him to drink , wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the third hour , and they crucified him . <EOV> <SOV> And the superscription of his accusation was written over , THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> And with him they crucify two thieves , the one on his right hand , and the other on his left . <EOV> <SOV> And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was numbered with the transgressors . <EOV> <SOV> And they that passed by , railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , <EOV> <SOV> Save thyself , and come down from the cross . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise also the chief priests mocking , said among themselves with the scribes , He saved others , himself he can not save . <EOV> <SOV> Let Christ the king of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him , reviled him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land , until the ninth hour . <EOV> <SOV> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eloi , Eloi , lama , sabacthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? <EOV> <SOV> And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus cried with a loud voice , and expired . <EOV> <SOV> And the vail of the temple was rent in two , from the top to the bottom . <EOV> <SOV> And when the centurion who stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and expired , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> There were also women looking on at a distance , among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the younger , and of Joses , and Salome ; <EOV> <SOV> Who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered to him ; and many other women who came with him to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And now , when the evening was come , ( because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ) <EOV> <SOV> Joseph of Arimathea , an honorable counselor , who also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly to Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate wondered if he was already dead : and calling the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead . <EOV> <SOV> And when he knew it from the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> And he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses , beheld where he was laid . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him . <EOV> <SOV> And very early in the morning , the first day of the week , they came to the sepulcher at the rising of the sun : <EOV> <SOV> And they said among themselves , Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the sepulcher ? <EOV> <SOV> ( And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away ) for it was very great . <EOV> <SOV> And entering into the sepulcher , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were frightened . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Be not frightened : ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , who was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him : <EOV> <SOV> But go , tell his disciples and Peter , that he goeth before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said to you . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulcher ; for they trembled , and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus was risen early , the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven demons . <EOV> <SOV> And she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept . <EOV> <SOV> And they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen by her , believed not . <EOV> <SOV> After that , he appeared in another form to two of them , as they were walking and going into the country . <EOV> <SOV> And they went and told it to the residue : neither believed they them . <EOV> <SOV> Afterward he appeared to the eleven , as they sat at table , and upbraided them with their unbelief , and hardness of heart , because they believed not them who had seen him after he was risen . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth and is baptized , shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned . <EOV> <SOV> And these signs shall follow them that believe : In my name shall they cast out demons ; they shall speak in new languages ; <EOV> <SOV> They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover . <EOV> <SOV> So then after the Lord had spoken to them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they went forth , and preached every where , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
