<SOC> <SOV> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way . <EOV> <SOV> The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make ye ready the way of the Lord , Make his paths straight ; <EOV> <SOV> John came , who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins . <EOV> <SOV> And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea , and all they of Jerusalem ; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> And John was clothed with camel 's hair , and ' had ' a leathern girdle about his loins , and did eat locusts and wild honey . <EOV> <SOV> And he preached , saying , There cometh after me he that is mightier than I , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose . <EOV> <SOV> I baptized you in water ; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in the Jordan . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens rent asunder , and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him : <EOV> <SOV> And a voice came out of the heavens , Thou art my beloved Son , in thee I am well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness . <EOV> <SOV> And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan ; And he was with the wild beasts ; And the angels ministered unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Now after John was delivered up , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of God , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe in the gospel . <EOV> <SOV> And passing along by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea ; for they were fishers . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway they left the nets , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And going on a little further , he saw James the ' son ' of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the boat mending the nets . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , and went after him . <EOV> <SOV> And they go into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished at his teaching : For he taught them as having authority , and not as the scribes . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out , <EOV> <SOV> saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus thou Nazarene ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . <EOV> <SOV> And the unclean spirit , tearing him and crying with a loud voice , came out of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What is this ? a new teaching ! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits , and they obey him . <EOV> <SOV> And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway , when they were come out of the synagogue , they came into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John . <EOV> <SOV> Now Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fever ; and straightway they tell him of her : <EOV> <SOV> and he came and took her by the hand , and raised her up ; and the fever left her , and she ministered unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were sick , and them that were possessed with demons . <EOV> <SOV> And all the city was gathered together at the door . <EOV> <SOV> And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases , and cast out many demons ; and he suffered not the demons to speak , because they knew him . <EOV> <SOV> And in the morning , a great while before day , he rose up and went out , and departed into a desert place , and there prayed . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him ; <EOV> <SOV> and they found him , and say unto him , All are seeking thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Let us go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also ; for to this end came I forth . <EOV> <SOV> And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee , preaching and casting out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And there cometh to him a leper , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And being moved with compassion , he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou made clean . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway the leprosy departed from him , and he was made clean . <EOV> <SOV> And he strictly charged him , and straightway sent him out , <EOV> <SOV> and saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them . <EOV> <SOV> But he went out , and began to publish it much , and to spread abroad the matter , insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days , it was noised that he was in the house . <EOV> <SOV> And many were gathered together , so that there was no longer room ' for them ' , no , not even about the door : and he spake the word unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And they come , bringing unto him a man sick of the palsy , borne of four . <EOV> <SOV> And when they could not come nigh unto him for the crowd , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed whereon the sick of the palsy lay . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus seeing their faith saith unto the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins are forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> But there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts , <EOV> <SOV> Why doth this man thus speak ? he blasphemeth : who can forgive sins but one , ' even ' God ? <EOV> <SOV> And straightway Jesus , perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , saith unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Which is easier , to say to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( he saith to the sick of the palsy ) , <EOV> <SOV> I say unto thee , Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and straightway took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion . <EOV> <SOV> And he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And as he passed by , he saw Levi the ' son ' of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll , and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that he was sitting at meat in his house , and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes of the Pharisees , when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans , said unto his disciples , ' How is it ' that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners . <EOV> <SOV> And John 's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting : and they come and say unto him , Why do John 's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Can the sons of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast . <EOV> <SOV> But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day . <EOV> <SOV> No man seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment : else that which should fill it up taketh from it , the new from the old , and a worse rent is made . <EOV> <SOV> And no man putteth new wine into old wineskins ; else the wine will burst the skins , and the wine perisheth , and the skins : but ' they put ' new wine into fresh wine - skins . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that he was going on the sabbath day through the grainfields ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Did ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was hungry , he , and they that were with him ? <EOV> <SOV> How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest , and ate the showbread , which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests , and gave also to them that were with him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , The sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath : <EOV> <SOV> so that the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there who had his hand withered . <EOV> <SOV> And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered , Stand forth . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? But they held their peace . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved at the hardening of their heart , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he stretched it forth ; and his hand was restored . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees went out , and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him , how they might destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed ; and from Judaea , <EOV> <SOV> and from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and beyond the Jordan , and about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , hearing what great things he did , came unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake to his disciples , that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd , lest they should throng him : <EOV> <SOV> for he had healed many ; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him . <EOV> <SOV> And the unclean spirits , whensoever they beheld him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them much that they should not make him known . <EOV> <SOV> And he goeth up into the mountain , and calleth unto him whom he himself would ; and they went unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And he appointed twelve , that they might be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach , <EOV> <SOV> and to have authority to cast out demons : <EOV> <SOV> and Simon he surnamed Peter ; <EOV> <SOV> and James the ' son ' of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and them he surnamed Boanerges , which is , Sons of thunder : <EOV> <SOV> and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the ' son ' of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Cananaean , <EOV> <SOV> and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him . And he cometh into a house . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread . <EOV> <SOV> And when his friends heard it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said , He hath Beelzebub , and , By the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons . <EOV> <SOV> And he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ? <EOV> <SOV> And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand . <EOV> <SOV> And if a house be divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand . <EOV> <SOV> And if Satan hath rise up against himself , and is divided , he can not stand , but hath an end . <EOV> <SOV> But no one can enter into the house of the strong ' man ' , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong ' man ' ; and then he will spoil his house . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme : <EOV> <SOV> but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness , but is guilty of an eternal sin : <EOV> <SOV> because they said , He hath an unclean spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And there come his mother and his brethren ; and , standing without , they sent unto him , calling him . <EOV> <SOV> And a multitude was sitting about him ; and they say unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he answereth them , and saith , Who is my mother and my brethren ? <EOV> <SOV> And looking round on them that sat round about him , he saith , Behold , my mother and my brethren ! <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And again he began to teach by the sea side . And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude , so that he entered into a boat , and sat in the sea ; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught them many things in parables , and said unto them in his teaching , <EOV> <SOV> Hearken : Behold , the sower went forth to sow : <EOV> <SOV> and it came to pass , as he sowed , some ' seed ' fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured it . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell on the rocky ' ground ' , where it had not much earth ; and straightway it sprang up , because it had no deepness of earth : <EOV> <SOV> and when the sun was risen , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell among the thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit . <EOV> <SOV> And others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing ; and brought forth , thirtyfold , and sixtyfold , and a hundredfold . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Who hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all things are done in parables : <EOV> <SOV> that seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest haply they should turn again , and it should be forgiven them . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Know ye not this parable ? and how shall ye know all the parables ? <EOV> <SOV> The sower soweth the word . <EOV> <SOV> And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; and when they have heard , straightway cometh Satan , and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them . <EOV> <SOV> And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky ' places ' , who , when they have heard the word , straightway receive it with joy ; <EOV> <SOV> and they have no root in themselves , but endure for a while ; then , when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway they stumble . <EOV> <SOV> And others are they that are sown among the thorns ; these are they that have heard the word , <EOV> <SOV> and the cares of the world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> And those are they that were sown upon the good ground ; such as hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , thirtyfold , and sixtyfold , and a hundredfold . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel , or under the bed , ' and ' not to be put on the stand ? <EOV> <SOV> For there is nothing hid , save that it should be manifested ; neither was ' anything ' made secret , but that it should come to light . <EOV> <SOV> If any man hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you ; and more shall be given unto you . <EOV> <SOV> For he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed upon the earth ; <EOV> <SOV> and should sleep and rise night and day , and the seed should spring up and grow , he knoweth not how . <EOV> <SOV> The earth beareth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear . <EOV> <SOV> But when the fruit is ripe , straightway he putteth forth the sickle , because the harvest is come . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , How shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or in what parable shall we set it forth ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown upon the earth , though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth , <EOV> <SOV> yet when it is sown , groweth up , and becometh greater than all the herbs , and putteth out great branches ; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof . <EOV> <SOV> And with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it ; <EOV> <SOV> and without a parable spake he not unto them : but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things . <EOV> <SOV> And on that day , when even was come , he saith unto them , Let us go over unto the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And leaving the multitude , they take him with them , even as he was , in the boat . And other boats were with him . <EOV> <SOV> And there ariseth a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the boat , insomuch that the boat was now filling . <EOV> <SOV> And he himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion : and they awake him , and say unto him , Teacher , carest thou not that we perish ? <EOV> <SOV> And he awoke , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Why are ye fearful ? have ye not yet faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And they came to the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gerasenes . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come out of the boat , straightway there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit , <EOV> <SOV> who had his dwelling in the tombs : and no man could any more bind him , no , not with a chain ; <EOV> <SOV> because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been rent asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : and no man had strength to tame him . <EOV> <SOV> And always , night and day , in the tombs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw Jesus from afar , he ran and worshipped him ; <EOV> <SOV> and crying out with a loud voice , he saith , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the Most High God ? I adjure thee by God , torment me not . <EOV> <SOV> For he said unto him , Come forth , thou unclean spirit , out of the man . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he saith unto him , My name is Legion ; for we are many . <EOV> <SOV> And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country . <EOV> <SOV> Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine feeding . <EOV> <SOV> And they besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them . <EOV> <SOV> And he gave them leave . And the unclean spirits came out , and entered into the swine : and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea , ' in number ' about two thousand ; and they were drowned in the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And they that fed them fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they came to see what it was that had come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jesus , and behold him that was possessed with demons sitting , clothed and in his right mind , ' even ' him that had the legion : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And they that saw it declared unto them how it befell him that was possessed with demons , and concerning the swine . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to beseech him to depart from their borders . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was entering into the boat , he that had been possessed with demons besought him that he might be with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he suffered him not , but saith unto him , Go to thy house unto thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and ' how ' he had mercy on thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he went his way , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men marvelled . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat unto the other side , a great multitude was gathered unto him ; and he was by the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and seeing him , he falleth at his feet , <EOV> <SOV> and beseecheth him much , saying , My little daughter is at the point of death : ' I pray thee ' , that thou come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be made whole , and live . <EOV> <SOV> And he went with him ; and a great multitude followed him , and they thronged him . <EOV> <SOV> And a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years , <EOV> <SOV> and had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse , <EOV> <SOV> having heard the things concerning Jesus , came in the crowd behind , and touched his garment . <EOV> <SOV> For she said , If I touch but his garments , I shall be made whole . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway Jesus , perceiving in himself that the power ' proceeding ' from him had gone forth , turned him about in the crowd , and said , Who touched my garments ? <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ? <EOV> <SOV> And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing . <EOV> <SOV> But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what had been done to her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague . <EOV> <SOV> While he yet spake , they come from the ruler of the synagogue 's ' house ' saying , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Teacher any further ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus , not heeding the word spoken , saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Fear not , only believe . <EOV> <SOV> And he suffered no man to follow with him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue ; and he beholdeth a tumult , and ' many ' weeping and wailing greatly . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was entered in , he saith unto them , Why make ye a tumult , and weep ? the child is not dead , but sleepeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they laughed him to scorn . But he , having put them all forth , taketh the father of the child and her mother and them that were with him , and goeth in where the child was . <EOV> <SOV> And taking the child by the hand , he saith unto her , Talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , Damsel , I say unto thee , Arise . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway the damsel rose up , and walked ; for she was twelve years old . And they were amazed straightway with a great amazement . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them much that no man should know this : and he commanded that ' something ' should be given her to eat . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he went out from thence ; and he cometh into his own country ; and his disciples follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the sabbath was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astonished , saying , Whence hath this man these things ? and , What is the wisdom that is given unto this man , and ' what mean ' such mighty works wrought by his hands ? <EOV> <SOV> Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , and Joses , and Judas , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended in him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house . <EOV> <SOV> And he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And he marvelled because of their unbelief . And he went round about the villages teaching . <EOV> <SOV> And he calleth unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits ; <EOV> <SOV> and he charged them that they should take nothing for ' their ' journey , save a staff only ; no bread , no wallet , now money in their purse ; <EOV> <SOV> but ' to go ' shod with sandals : and , ' said he ' , put not on two coats . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Wheresoever ye enter into a house , there abide till ye depart thence . <EOV> <SOV> And whatsoever place shall not receive you , and they hear you not , as ye go forth thence , shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out , and preached that ' men ' should repent . <EOV> <SOV> And they cast out many demons , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And king Herod heard ' thereof ' ; for his name had become known : and he said , John the Baptizer is risen from the dead , and therefore do these powers work in him . <EOV> <SOV> But others said , It is Elijah . And others said , ' It is ' a prophet , ' even ' as one of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But Herod , when he heard ' thereof ' , said , John , whom I beheaded , he is risen . <EOV> <SOV> For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife ; for he had married her . <EOV> <SOV> For John said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> And Herodias set herself against him , and desired to kill him ; and she could not ; <EOV> <SOV> for Herod feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and kept him safe . And when he heard him , he was much perplexed ; and he heard him gladly . <EOV> <SOV> And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , and the high captains , and the chief men of Galilee ; <EOV> <SOV> and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced , she pleased Herod and them that sat at meat with him ; and the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he sware unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And she went out , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptizer . <EOV> <SOV> And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And the king was exceeding sorry ; but for the sake of his oaths , and of them that sat at meat , he would not reject her . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway the king sent forth a soldier of his guard , and commanded to bring his head : and he went and beheaded him in the prison , <EOV> <SOV> and brought his head on a platter , and gave it to the damsel ; and the damsel gave it to her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples heard ' thereof ' , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles gather themselves together unto Jesus ; and they told him all things , whatsoever they had done , and whatsoever they had taught . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while . For there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart . <EOV> <SOV> And ' the people ' saw them going , and many knew ' them ' , and they ran together there on foot from all the cities , and outwent them . <EOV> <SOV> And he came forth and saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things . <EOV> <SOV> And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , The place is desert , and the day is now far spent ; <EOV> <SOV> send them away , that they may go into the country and villages round about , and buy themselves somewhat to eat . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred shillings ' worth of bread , and give them to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go ' and ' see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies upon the green grass . <EOV> <SOV> And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake the loaves ; and he gave to the disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate , and were filled . <EOV> <SOV> And they took up broken pieces , twelve basketfuls , and also of the fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And they that ate the loaves were five thousand men . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat , and to go before ' him ' unto the other side to Bethsaida , while he himself sendeth the multitude away . <EOV> <SOV> And after he had taken leave of them , he departed into the mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And when even was come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing them distressed in rowing , for the wind was contrary unto them , about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking on the sea ; and he would have passed by them : <EOV> <SOV> but they , when they saw him walking on the sea , supposed that it was a ghost , and cried out ; <EOV> <SOV> for they all saw him , and were troubled . But he straightway spake with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And he went up unto them into the boat ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves ; <EOV> <SOV> for they understood not concerning the loaves , but their heart was hardened . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had crossed over , they came to the land unto Gennesaret , and moored to the shore . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were come out of the boat , straightway ' the people ' knew him , <EOV> <SOV> and ran round about that whole region , and began to carry about on their beds those that were sick , where they heard he was . <EOV> <SOV> And wheresoever he entered , into villages , or into cities , or into the country , they laid the sick in the marketplaces , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , who had come from Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled , that is , unwashen , hands . <EOV> <SOV> ( For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands diligently , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders ; <EOV> <SOV> and ' when they come ' from the market - place , except they bathe themselves , they eat not ; and many other things there are , which they have received to hold , washings of cups , and pots , and brasen vessels . ) <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with defiled hands ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoreth me with their lips , But their heart is far from me . <EOV> <SOV> But in vain do they worship me , Teaching ' as their ' doctrines the precepts of men . <EOV> <SOV> Ye leave the commandment of God , and hold fast the tradition of men . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Full well do ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your tradition . <EOV> <SOV> For Moses said , Honor thy father and thy mother ; and , He that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him die the death : <EOV> <SOV> but ye say , If a man shall say to his father or his mother , That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban , that is to say , Given ' to God ' ; <EOV> <SOV> ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother ; <EOV> <SOV> making void the word of God by your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things ye do . <EOV> <SOV> And he called to him the multitude again , and said unto them , Hear me all of you , and understand : <EOV> <SOV> there is nothing from without the man , that going into him can defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> ' If any man hath ears to hear , let him hear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And when he was entered into the house from the multitude , his disciples asked of him the parable . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? Perceive ye not , that whatsoever from without goeth into the man , ' it ' can not defile him ; <EOV> <SOV> because it goeth not into his heart , but into his belly , and goeth out into the draught ? ' This he said ' , making all meats clean . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , That which proceedeth out of the man , that defileth the man . <EOV> <SOV> For from within , out of the heart of men , evil thoughts proceed , fornications , thefts , murders , adulteries , <EOV> <SOV> covetings , wickednesses , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , railing , pride , foolishness : <EOV> <SOV> all these evil things proceed from within , and defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> And from thence he arose , and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon . And he entered into a house , and would have no man know it ; and he could not be hid . <EOV> <SOV> But straightway a woman , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having heard of him , came and fell down at his feet . <EOV> <SOV> Now the woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by race . And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children 's bread and cast it to the dogs . <EOV> <SOV> But she answered and saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; even the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crumbs . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , For this saying go thy way ; the demon is gone out of thy daughter . <EOV> <SOV> And she went away unto her house , and found the child laid upon the bed , and the demon gone out . <EOV> <SOV> And again he went out from the borders of Tyre , and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the borders of Decapolis . <EOV> <SOV> And they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And he took him aside from the multitude privately , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spat , and touched his tongue ; <EOV> <SOV> and looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened . <EOV> <SOV> And his ears were opened , and the bond of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it . <EOV> <SOV> And they were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well ; he maketh even the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In those days , when there was again a great multitude , and they had nothing to eat , he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , <EOV> <SOV> I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : <EOV> <SOV> and if I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way ; and some of them are come from far . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples answered him , Whence shall one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place ? <EOV> <SOV> And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven . <EOV> <SOV> And he commandeth the multitude to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and having given thanks , he brake , and gave to his disciples , to set before them ; and they set them before the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they had a few small fishes : and having blessed them , he commanded to set these also before them . <EOV> <SOV> And they ate , and were filled : and they took up , of broken pieces that remained over , seven baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And they were about four thousand : and he sent them away . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway he entered into the boat with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , trying him . <EOV> <SOV> And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And he left them , and again entering into ' the boat ' departed to the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And they forgot to take bread ; and they had not in the boat with them more than one loaf . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned one with another , saying , We have no bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus perceiving it saith unto them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? do ye not yet perceive , neither understand ? have ye your heart hardened ? <EOV> <SOV> Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ? <EOV> <SOV> When I brake the five loaves among the five thousand , how many baskets full of broken pieces took ye up ? They say unto him , Twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And when the seven among the four thousand , how many basketfuls of broken pieces took ye up ? And they say unto him , Seven . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Do ye not yet understand ? <EOV> <SOV> And they come unto Bethsaida . And they bring to him a blind man , and beseech him to touch him . <EOV> <SOV> And he took hold of the blind man by the hand , and brought him out of the village ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and laid his hands upon him , he asked him , Seest thou aught ? <EOV> <SOV> And he looked up , and said , I see men ; for I behold ' them ' as trees , walking . <EOV> <SOV> Then again he laid his hands upon his eyes ; and he looked stedfastly , and was restored , and saw all things clearly . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent him away to his home , saying , Do not even enter into the village . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went forth , and his disciples , into the villages of Caesarea Philippi : and on the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Who do men say that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And they told him , saying , John the Baptist ; and others , Elijah ; but others , One of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked them , But who say ye that I am ? Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , and the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake the saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him . <EOV> <SOV> But he turning about , and seeing his disciples , rebuked Peter , and saith , Get thee behind me , Satan ; for thou mindest not the things of God , but the things of men . <EOV> <SOV> And he called unto him the multitude with his disciples , and said unto them , If any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever would save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's shall save it . <EOV> <SOV> For what doth it profit a man , to gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ? <EOV> <SOV> For what should a man give in exchange for his life ? <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There are some here of them that stand ' by ' , who shall in no wise taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God come with power . <EOV> <SOV> And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them ; <EOV> <SOV> and his garments became glistering , exceeding white , so as no fuller on earth can whiten them . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answereth and saith to Jesus , Rabbi , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> For he knew not what to answer ; for they became sore afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a cloud overshadowing them : and there came a voice out of the cloud , This is my beloved Son : hear ye him . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly looking round about , they saw no one any more , save Jesus only with themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were coming down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , save when the Son of man should have risen again from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> And they kept the saying , questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , ' How is it ' that the scribes say that Elijah must first come ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Elijah indeed cometh first , and restoreth all things : and how is it written of the Son of man , that he should suffer many things and be set at nought ? <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , that Elijah is come , and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would , even as it is written of him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came to the disciples , they saw a great multitude about them , and scribes questioning with them . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway all the multitude , when they saw him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked them , What question ye with them ? <EOV> <SOV> And one of the multitude answered him , Teacher , I brought unto thee my son , who hath a dumb spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> and wheresoever it taketh him , it dasheth him down : and he foameth , and grindeth his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast it out ; and they were not able . <EOV> <SOV> And he answereth them and saith , O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? bring him unto me . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him grievously ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked his father , How long time is it since this hath come unto him ? And he said , From a child . <EOV> <SOV> And oft - times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do anything , have compassion on us , and help us . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , If thou canst ! All things are possible to him that believeth . <EOV> <SOV> Straightway the father of the child cried out , and said , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebuked the unclean spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I command thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him . <EOV> <SOV> And having cried out , and torn him much , he came out : and ' the boy ' became as one dead ; insomuch that the more part said , He is dead . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus took him by the hand , and raised him up ; and he arose . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , ' How is it ' that we could not cast it out ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , This kind can come out by nothing , save by prayer . <EOV> <SOV> And they went forth from thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it . <EOV> <SOV> For he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered up into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and when he is killed , after three days he shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> But they understood not the saying , and were afraid to ask him . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to Capernaum : and when he was in the house he asked them , What were ye reasoning on the way ? <EOV> <SOV> But they held their peace : for they had disputed one with another on the way , who ' was ' the greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And he sat down , and called the twelve ; and he saith unto them , If any man would be first , he shall be last of all , and servant of all . <EOV> <SOV> And he took a little child , and set him in the midst of them : and taking him in his arms , he said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever receiveth me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> John said unto him , Teacher , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbade him , because he followed not us . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Forbid him not : for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name , and be able quickly to speak evil of me . <EOV> <SOV> For he that is not against us is for us . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink , because ye are Christ 's , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble , it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy hand cause thee to stumble , cut it off : it is good for thee to enter into life maimed , rather than having thy two hands to go into hell , into the unquenchable fire . <EOV> <SOV> ' where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . ' <EOV> <SOV> And if thy foot cause thee to stumble , cut it off : it is good for thee to enter into life halt , rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell . <EOV> <SOV> ' where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . ' <EOV> <SOV> And if thine eye cause thee to stumble , cast it out : it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell ; <EOV> <SOV> where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched . <EOV> <SOV> For every one shall be salted with fire . <EOV> <SOV> Salt is good : but if the salt have lost its saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and be at peace one with another . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he arose from thence and cometh into the borders of Judaea and beyond the Jordan : and multitudes come together unto him again ; and , as he was wo nt , he taught them again . <EOV> <SOV> And there came unto him Pharisees , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away ' his ' wife ? trying him . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said unto them , For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment . <EOV> <SOV> But from the beginning of the creation , Male and female made he them . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; <EOV> <SOV> and the two shall become one flesh : so that they are no more two , but one flesh . <EOV> <SOV> What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . <EOV> <SOV> And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her : <EOV> <SOV> and if she herself shall put away her husband , and marry another , she committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> And they were bringing unto him little children , that he should touch them : and the disciples rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus saw it , he was moved with indignation , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me ; forbid them not : for to such belongeth the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall in no wise enter therein . <EOV> <SOV> And he took them in his arms , and blessed them , laying his hands upon them . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was going forth into the way , there ran one to him , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good save one , ' even ' God . <EOV> <SOV> Thou knowest the commandments , Do not kill , Do not commit adultery , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Do not defraud , Honor thy father and mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Teacher , all these things have I observed from my youth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus looking upon him loved him , and said unto him , One thing thou lackest : go , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> But his countenance fell at the saying , and he went away sorrowful : for he was one that had great possessions . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples were amazed at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> It is easier for a camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished exceedingly , saying unto him , Then who can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for all things are possible with God . <EOV> <SOV> Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or mother , or father , or children , or lands , for my sake , and for the gospel 's sake , <EOV> <SOV> but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> But many ' that are ' first shall be last ; and the last first . <EOV> <SOV> And they were on the way , going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus was going before them : and they were amazed ; and they that followed were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them the things that were to happen unto him , <EOV> <SOV> ' saying ' , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles : <EOV> <SOV> and they shall mock him , and shall spit upon him , and shall scourge him , and shall kill him ; and after three days he shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And there come near unto him James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying unto him , Teacher , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall ask of thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and one on ' thy ' left hand , in thy glory . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink the cup that I drink ? or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , We are able . And Jesus said unto them , The cup that I drink ye shall drink ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized : <EOV> <SOV> but to sit on my right hand or on ' my ' left hand is not mine to give ; but ' it is for them ' for whom it hath been prepared . <EOV> <SOV> And when the ten heard it , they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them ; and their great ones exercise authority over them . <EOV> <SOV> But it is not so among you : but whosoever would become great among you , shall be your minister ; <EOV> <SOV> and whosoever would be first among you , shall be servant of all . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man also came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jericho : and as he went out from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , the son of Timaeus , Bartimaeus , a blind beggar , was sitting by the way side . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And many rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried out the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood still , and said , Call ye him . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good cheer : rise , he calleth thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he , casting away his garment , sprang up , and came to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered him , and said , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? And the blind man said unto him , Rabboni , that I may receive my sight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And straightway he received his sight , and followed him in the way . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and saith unto them , Go your way into the village that is over against you : and straightway as ye enter into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon no man ever yet sat ; loose him , and bring him . <EOV> <SOV> And if any one say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye , The Lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him back hither . <EOV> <SOV> And they went away , and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street ; and they loose him . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto them even as Jesus had said : and they let them go . <EOV> <SOV> And they bring the colt unto Jesus , and cast on him their garments ; and he sat upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And many spread their garments upon the way ; and others branches , which they had cut from the fields . <EOV> <SOV> And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , Hosanna ; Blessed ' is ' he that cometh in the name of the Lord : <EOV> <SOV> Blessed ' is ' the kingdom that cometh , ' the kingdom ' of our father David : Hosanna in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And he entered into Jerusalem , into the temple ; and when he had looked round about upon all things , it being now eventide , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow , when they were come out from Bethany , he hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find anything thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for it was not the season of figs . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto it , No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever . And his disciples heard it . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jerusalem : and he entered into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money - changers , and the seats of them that sold the doves ; <EOV> <SOV> and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught , and said unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations ? but ye have made it a den of robbers . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching . <EOV> <SOV> And every evening he went forth out of the city . <EOV> <SOV> And as they passed by in the morning , they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , Rabbi , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou taken up and cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass ; he shall have it . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I say unto you , All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them . <EOV> <SOV> And whensoever ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have aught against any one ; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses . <EOV> <SOV> ' But if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ; <EOV> <SOV> and they said unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? or who gave thee this authority to do these things ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , I will ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? answer me . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; He will say , Why then did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> But should we say , From men -- they feared the people : for all verily held John to be a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered Jesus and say , We know not . And Jesus saith unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he began to speak unto them in parables . A man planted a vineyard , and set a hedge about it , and digged a pit for the winepress , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into another country . <EOV> <SOV> And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruits of the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And they took him , and beat him , and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent unto them another servant ; and him they wounded in the head , and handled shamefully . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent another ; and him they killed : and many others ; beating some , and killing some . <EOV> <SOV> He had yet one , a beloved son : he sent him last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son . <EOV> <SOV> But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours . <EOV> <SOV> And they took him , and killed him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others . <EOV> <SOV> Have ye not read even this scripture : The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ; <EOV> <SOV> This was from the Lord , And it is marvellous in our eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> And they sought to lay hold on him ; and they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spake the parable against them : and they left him , and went away . <EOV> <SOV> And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , that they might catch him in talk . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were come , they say unto him , Teacher , we know that thou art true , and carest not for any one ; for thou regardest not the person of men , but of a truth teachest the way of God : Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why make ye trial of me ? bring me a denarius , that I may see it . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought it . And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and unto God the things that are God 's . And they marvelled greatly at him . <EOV> <SOV> And there come unto him Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Teacher , Moses wrote unto us , If a man 's brother die , and leave a wife behind him , and leave no child , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . <EOV> <SOV> There were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed ; <EOV> <SOV> and the second took her , and died , leaving no seed behind him ; and the third likewise : <EOV> <SOV> and the seven left no seed . Last of all the woman also died . <EOV> <SOV> In the resurrection whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them , Is it not for this cause that ye err , that ye know not the scriptures , nor the power of God ? <EOV> <SOV> For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as angels in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But as touching the dead , that they are raised ; have ye not read in the book of Moses , in ' the place concerning ' the Bush , how God spake unto him , saying , I ' am ' the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not the God of the dead , but of the living : ye do greatly err . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the scribes came , and heard them questioning together , and knowing that he had answered them well , asked him , What commandment is the first of all ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , The first is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God , the Lord is one : <EOV> <SOV> and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength . <EOV> <SOV> The second is this , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . There is none other commandment greater than these . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribe said unto him , Of a truth , Teacher , thou hast well said that he is one ; and there is none other but he : <EOV> <SOV> and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is much more than all whole burnt - offerings and sacrifices . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said , as he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that the Christ is the son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> David himself said in the Holy Spirit , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet . <EOV> <SOV> David himself calleth him Lord ; and whence is he his son ? And the common people heard him gladly . <EOV> <SOV> And in his teaching he said , Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and ' to have ' salutations in the marketplaces , <EOV> <SOV> and chief seats in the synagogues , and chief places at feasts : <EOV> <SOV> they that devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers ; these shall receive greater condemnation . <EOV> <SOV> And he sat down over against the treasury , and beheld how the multitude cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a poor widow , and she cast in two mites , which make a farthing . <EOV> <SOV> And he called unto him his disciples , and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , This poor widow cast in more than all they that are casting into the treasury : <EOV> <SOV> for they all did cast in of their superfluity ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , ' even ' all her living . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as he went forth out of the temple , one of his disciples saith unto him , Teacher , behold , what manner of stones and what manner of buildings ! <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left here one stone upon another , which shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately , <EOV> <SOV> Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what ' shall be ' the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus began to say unto them , Take heed that no man lead you astray . <EOV> <SOV> Many shall come in my name , saying , I am ' he ' ; and shall lead many astray . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars , be not troubled : ' these things ' must needs come to pass ; but the end is not yet . <EOV> <SOV> For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; there shall be earthquakes in divers places ; there shall be famines : these things are the beginning of travail . <EOV> <SOV> But take ye heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in synagogues shall ye be beaten ; and before governors and kings shall ye stand for my sake , for a testimony unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And the gospel must first be preached unto all the nations . <EOV> <SOV> And when they lead you ' to judgment ' , and deliver you up , be not anxious beforehand what ye shall speak : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye ; for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and the father his child ; and children shall rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye see the abomination of desolation standing where he ought not ( let him that readeth understand ) , then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains : <EOV> <SOV> and let him that is on the housetop not go down , nor enter in , to take anything out his house : <EOV> <SOV> and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days ! <EOV> <SOV> And pray ye that it be not in the winter . <EOV> <SOV> For those days shall be tribulation , such as there hath not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never shall be . <EOV> <SOV> And except the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the elect 's sake , whom he chose , he shortened the days . <EOV> <SOV> And then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is the Christ ; or , Lo , there ; believe ' it ' not : <EOV> <SOV> for there shall arise false Christs and false prophets , and shall show signs and wonders , that they may lead astray , if possible , the elect . <EOV> <SOV> But take ye heed : behold , I have told you all things beforehand . <EOV> <SOV> But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , <EOV> <SOV> and the stars shall be falling from heaven , and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall he send forth the angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Now from the fig tree learn her parable : when her branch is now become tender , and putteth forth its leaves , ye know that the summer is nigh ; <EOV> <SOV> even so ye also , when ye see these things coming to pass , know ye that he is nigh , ' even ' at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , until all these things be accomplished . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But of that day or that hour knoweth no one , not even the angels in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is . <EOV> <SOV> ' It is ' as ' when ' a man , sojourning in another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , to each one his work , commanded also the porter to watch . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore : for ye know not when the lord of the house cometh , whether at even , or at midnight , or at cockcrowing , or in the morning ; <EOV> <SOV> lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping . <EOV> <SOV> And what I say unto you I say unto all , Watch . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now after two days was ' the feast of ' the passover and the unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety , and kill him : <EOV> <SOV> for they said , Not during the feast , lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly ; ' and ' she brake the cruse , and poured it over his head . <EOV> <SOV> But there were some that had indignation among themselves , ' saying ' , To what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made ? <EOV> <SOV> For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings , and given to the poor . And they murmured against her . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me . <EOV> <SOV> For ye have the poor always with you , and whensoever ye will ye can do them good : but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> She hath done what she could ; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying . <EOV> <SOV> And verily I say unto you , Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas Iscariot , he that was one of the twelve , went away unto the chief priests , that he might deliver him unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And they , when they heard it , were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him ' unto them ' . <EOV> <SOV> And on the first day of unleavened bread , when they sacrificed the passover , his disciples say unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover ? <EOV> <SOV> And he sendeth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him ; <EOV> <SOV> and wheresoever he shall enter in , say to the master of the house , The Teacher saith , Where is my guest - chamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished ' and ' ready : and there make ready for us . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And as they sat and were eating , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you shall betray me , ' even ' he that eateth with me . <EOV> <SOV> They began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' It is ' one of the twelve , he that dippeth with me in the dish . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man goeth , even as it is written of him : but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had not been born . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating , he took bread , and when he had blessed , he brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take ye : this is my body . <EOV> <SOV> And he took a cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave to them : and they all drank of it . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , This is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had sung a hymn , they went out unto the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be offended : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> Howbeit , after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I. <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that thou to - day , ' even ' this night , before the cock crow twice , shalt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> But he spake exceedingly vehemently , If I must die with thee , I will not deny thee . And in like manner also said they all . <EOV> <SOV> And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith unto his disciples , Sit ye here , while I pray . <EOV> <SOV> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be greatly amazed , and sore troubled . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death : abide ye here , and watch . <EOV> <SOV> And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; remove this cup from me : howbeit not what I will , but what thou wilt . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest thou not watch one hour ? <EOV> <SOV> Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . <EOV> <SOV> And again he went away , and prayed , saying the same words . <EOV> <SOV> And again he came , and found them sleeping , for their eyes were very heavy ; and they knew not what to answer him . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough ; the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Arise , let us be going : behold , he that betrayeth me is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders . <EOV> <SOV> Now he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he ; take him , and lead him away safely . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come , straightway he came to him , and saith , Rabbi ; and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And they laid hands on him , and took him . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword , and smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a robber , with swords and staves to seize me ? <EOV> <SOV> I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but ' this is done ' that the scriptures might be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And they all left him , and fled . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain young man followed with him , having a linen cloth cast about him , over ' his ' naked ' body ' : and they lay hold on him ; <EOV> <SOV> but he left the linen cloth , and fled naked . <EOV> <SOV> And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter had followed him afar off , even within , into the court of the high priest ; and he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself in the light ' of the fire ' . <EOV> <SOV> Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found it not . <EOV> <SOV> For many bare false witness against him , and their witness agreed not together . <EOV> <SOV> And there stood up certain , and bare false witness against him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands . <EOV> <SOV> And not even so did their witness agree together . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and saith unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming with the clouds of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What further need have we of witnesses ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death . <EOV> <SOV> And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the officers received him with blows of their hands . <EOV> <SOV> And as Peter was beneath in the court , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest ; <EOV> <SOV> and seeing Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and saith , Thou also wast with the Nazarene , ' even ' Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied , saying , I neither know , nor understand what thou sayest : and he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And the maid saw him , and began again to say to them that stood by , This is ' one ' of them . <EOV> <SOV> But he again denied it . And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter , of a truth thou art ' one ' of them ; for thou art a Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> But he began to curse , and to swear , I know not this man of whom ye speak . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word , how that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes , and the whole council , held a consultation , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him up to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answering saith unto him , Thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests accused him of many things . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate again asked him , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they accuse thee of . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus no more answered anything ; insomuch that Pilate marvelled . <EOV> <SOV> Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner , whom they asked of him . <EOV> <SOV> And there was one called Barabbas , ' lying ' bound with them that had made insurrection , men who in the insurrection had committed murder . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude went up and began to ask him ' to do ' as he was wo nt to do unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate again answered and said unto them , What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> And they cried out again , Crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out exceedingly , Crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate , wishing to content the multitude , released unto them Barabbas , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers led him away within the court , which is the Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band . <EOV> <SOV> And they clothe him with purple , and platting a crown of thorns , they put it on him ; <EOV> <SOV> and they began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews ! <EOV> <SOV> And they smote his head with a reed , and spat upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had mocked him , they took off from him the purple , and put on him his garments . And they lead him out to crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And they compel one passing by , Simon of Cyrene , coming from the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to go ' with them ' , that he might bear his cross . <EOV> <SOV> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull . <EOV> <SOV> And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not . <EOV> <SOV> And they crucify him , and part his garments among them , casting lots upon them , what each should take . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the third hour , and they crucified him . <EOV> <SOV> And the superscription of his accusation was written over , THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> And with him they crucify two robbers ; one on his right hand , and one on his left . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was reckoned with transgressors . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ha ! Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , <EOV> <SOV> save thyself , and come down from the cross . <EOV> <SOV> In like manner also the chief priests mocking ' him ' among themselves with the scribes said , He saved others ; himself he can not save . <EOV> <SOV> Let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him reproached him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour . <EOV> <SOV> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? <EOV> <SOV> And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> And one ran , and filling a sponge full of vinegar , put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let be ; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus uttered a loud voice , and gave up the ghost . <EOV> <SOV> And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom . <EOV> <SOV> And when the centurion , who stood by over against him , saw that he so gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And there were also women beholding from afar : among whom ' were ' both Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ; <EOV> <SOV> who , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when even was now come , because it was the Preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath , <EOV> <SOV> there came Joseph of Arimathaea , a councillor of honorable estate , who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God ; and he boldly went in unto Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead . <EOV> <SOV> And when he learned it of the centurion , he granted the corpse to Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> And he bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock ; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the ' mother ' of Joses beheld where he was laid . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the ' mother ' of James , and Salome , bought spices , that they might come and anoint him . <EOV> <SOV> And very early on the first day of the week , they come to the tomb when the sun was risen . <EOV> <SOV> And they were saying among themselves , Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb ? <EOV> <SOV> and looking up , they see that the stone is rolled back : for it was exceeding great . <EOV> <SOV> And entering into the tomb , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , arrayed in a white robe ; and they were amazed . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Be not amazed : ye seek Jesus , the Nazarene , who hath been crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold , the place where they laid him ! <EOV> <SOV> But go , tell his disciples and Peter , He goeth before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And they went out , and fled from the tomb ; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them : and they said nothing to any one ; for they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , from whom he had cast out seven demons . <EOV> <SOV> She went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept . <EOV> <SOV> And they , when they heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , disbelieved . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country . <EOV> <SOV> And they went away and told it unto the rest : neither believed they them . <EOV> <SOV> And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat ; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to the whole creation . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned . <EOV> <SOV> And these signs shall accompany them that believe : in my name shall they cast out demons ; they shall speak with new tongues ; <EOV> <SOV> they shall take up serpents , and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall in no wise hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover . <EOV> <SOV> So then the Lord Jesus , after he had spoken unto them , was received up into heaven , and sat down at the right hand of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
