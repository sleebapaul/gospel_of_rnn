<SOC> <SOV> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us , <EOV> <SOV> Even as they delivered them to us , who from the beginning were eye - witnesses , and ministers of the word ; <EOV> <SOV> It seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write to thee in order , most excellent Theophilus , <EOV> <SOV> That thou mayest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed . <EOV> <SOV> There was in the days of Herod the king of Judea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless . <EOV> <SOV> And they had no child , because Elisabeth was barren , and they both were far advanced in years . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , while he executed the priests ' office before God in the order of his course , <EOV> <SOV> According to the custom of the priests ' office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without , at the time of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord , standing on the right side of the altar of incense . <EOV> <SOV> And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him . <EOV> <SOV> But the angel said to him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John . <EOV> <SOV> And thou shalt have joy and gladness , and many shall rejoice at his birth . <EOV> <SOV> For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit , even from his mother 's womb . <EOV> <SOV> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God . <EOV> <SOV> And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias said to the angel , By what shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife far advanced in years . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answering , said to him , I am Gabriel , who stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak to thee , and to show thee these glad tidings . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season . <EOV> <SOV> And the people waited for Zacharias , and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came out , he could not speak to them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple ; for he beckoned to them , and remained speechless . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house . <EOV> <SOV> And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived , and secluded herself five months , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days in which he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men . <EOV> <SOV> And in the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee , named Nazareth , <EOV> <SOV> To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel came to her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favored , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women . <EOV> <SOV> And when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said to her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favor with God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name JESUS . <EOV> <SOV> He will be great , and will be called the Son of the Highest ; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David . <EOV> <SOV> And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever , and of his kingdom there will be no end . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Mary to the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ? <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answered and said to her , The Holy Spirit will come upon thee , and the power of the Highest will overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren : <EOV> <SOV> For with God nothing will be impossible . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord , be it to me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill - country with haste , into a city of Judah , <EOV> <SOV> And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb : and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And she spoke with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . <EOV> <SOV> And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ? <EOV> <SOV> For lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed is she that believed that there will be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord , <EOV> <SOV> And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior . <EOV> <SOV> For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for behold , from henceforth all generations will call me blessed . <EOV> <SOV> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things , and holy is his name . <EOV> <SOV> And his mercy is on them that fear him , from generation to generation . <EOV> <SOV> He hath shown strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts . <EOV> <SOV> He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree . <EOV> <SOV> He hath filled the hungry with good things , and the rich he hath sent away empty . <EOV> <SOV> He hath sustained his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ; <EOV> <SOV> As he spoke to our fathers , to Abraham , and to his seed for ever . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house . <EOV> <SOV> Now Elisabeth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son . <EOV> <SOV> And her neighbors and her cousins heard that the Lord had shown great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father . <EOV> <SOV> And his mother answered and said , Not so ; but he shall be called John . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name . <EOV> <SOV> And they made signs to his father , how he would have him called . <EOV> <SOV> And he asked for a writing - table , and wrote , saying , His name is John . And they all wondered . <EOV> <SOV> And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spoke , and praised God . <EOV> <SOV> And fear came on all that dwelt around them ; and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill - country of Judea . <EOV> <SOV> And all they that had heard them , laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child will this be ! And the hand of the Lord was with him . <EOV> <SOV> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit , and prophesied , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people . <EOV> <SOV> And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us , in the house of his servant David : <EOV> <SOV> As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets , who have been since the world began : <EOV> <SOV> That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ; <EOV> <SOV> To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant : <EOV> <SOV> The oath which he swore to our father Abraham , <EOV> <SOV> That he would grant to us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies , might serve him without fear , <EOV> <SOV> In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest , for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ; <EOV> <SOV> To give knowledge of salvation to his people , by the remission of their sins , <EOV> <SOV> Through the tender mercy of our God ; by which the day - spring from on high hath visited us , <EOV> <SOV> To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shades of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace . <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew , and became strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus , that all the world should be taxed . <EOV> <SOV> ( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . ) <EOV> <SOV> And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David ) <EOV> <SOV> To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child . <EOV> <SOV> And so it was , that while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered . <EOV> <SOV> And she brought forth her first - born son , and wrapped him in swaddling - clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn . <EOV> <SOV> And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them ; and they were in great fear . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel said to them , Fear not : for behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people . <EOV> <SOV> For to you is born this day , in the city of David , a Savior , who is Christ the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And this shall be a sign to you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling - clothes , lying in a manger . <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good will towards men . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the angels had departed from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even to Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known to us . <EOV> <SOV> And they came with haste , and found Mary and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child . <EOV> <SOV> And all they that heard it , wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told to them . <EOV> <SOV> And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called JESUS , who was so named by the angel before he was conceived in the womb . <EOV> <SOV> And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ; <EOV> <SOV> ( As it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that is the first born of his mother shall be called holy to the Lord ) <EOV> <SOV> And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtle - doves , or two young pigeons . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Spirit was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And he came by the spirit into the temple ; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law , <EOV> <SOV> Then he took him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said , <EOV> <SOV> Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word : <EOV> <SOV> For my eyes have seen thy salvation , <EOV> <SOV> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ; <EOV> <SOV> A light to enlighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken concerning him . <EOV> <SOV> And Simeon blessed them , and said to Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ; <EOV> <SOV> ( And a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed . <EOV> <SOV> And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher : she was of a great age , and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity ; <EOV> <SOV> And she was a widow of about eighty four years , who departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day . <EOV> <SOV> And she coming in that instant , gave thanks likewise to the Lord , and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew , and became strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it . <EOV> <SOV> But they , supposing him to be in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their relations and acquaintance . <EOV> <SOV> And when they found him not , they returned to Jerusalem , seeking him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions . <EOV> <SOV> And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said to him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , How is it that ye sought me ? knew ye not that I must be about my Father 's business ? <EOV> <SOV> And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them . <EOV> <SOV> And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject to them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanius the tetrarch of Abilene , <EOV> <SOV> Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness . <EOV> <SOV> And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance , for the remission of sins ; <EOV> <SOV> As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . <EOV> <SOV> Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ; <EOV> <SOV> And all flesh shall see the salvation of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized by him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? <EOV> <SOV> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham for our father : for I say to you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit , is hewn down , and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> And the people asked him , saying , What shall we do then ? <EOV> <SOV> He answereth and saith to them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath provisions , let him do likewise . <EOV> <SOV> Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said to him , Master , what shall we do ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers likewise asked him , saying , And what shall we do ? And he said to them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely , and be content with your wages . <EOV> <SOV> And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts concerning John , whether he was the Christ , or not ; <EOV> <SOV> John answered , saying to them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit , and with fire : <EOV> <SOV> Whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor , and will gather the wheat into his granary ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . <EOV> <SOV> And many other things in his exhortation he preached to the people . <EOV> <SOV> But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him on account of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done , <EOV> <SOV> Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison . <EOV> <SOV> Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened , <EOV> <SOV> And the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , who was the son of Heli , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Matthat , who was the son of Levi , who was the son of Melchi , who was the son of Janna , who was the son of Joseph , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Mattathias , who was the son of Amos , who was the son of Naum , who was the son of Esli , who was the son of Nagge , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Maath , who was the son of Mattathias , who was the son of Semei , who was the son of Joseph , who was the son of Juda , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Joanna , who was the son of Rhesa , who was the son of Zorobabel , who was the son of Salathiel , who was the son of Neri , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Melchi , who was the son of Addi , who was the son of Cosam , who was the son of Elmodam , who was the son of Er , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Jose , who was the son of Eliezer , who was the son of Jorim , who was the son of Matthat , who was the son of Levi , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Simeon , who was the son of Judah , who was the son of Joseph , who was the son of Jonan , who was the son of Eliakim , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Melea , who was the son of Menan , who was the son of Mattatha , who was the son of Nathan , who was the son of David , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Jesse , who was the son of Obed , who was the son of Booz , who was the son of Salmon , who was the son of Naasson , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Aminadab , who was the son of Aram , who was the son of Esrom , who was the son of Phares , who was the son of Judah , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Jacob , who was the son of Isaac , who was the son of Abraham , who was the son of Terah , who was the son of Nahor , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Serug , who was the son of Reu , who was the son of Peleg , who was the son of Heber , who was the son of Sala , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Cainan , who was the son of Arphaxad , who was the son of Shem , who was the son of Noah , who was the son of Lamech , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Methuselah , who was the son of Enoch , who was the son of Jared , who was the son of Maleleel , who was the son of Cainan , <EOV> <SOV> Who was the son of Enos , who was the son of Seth , who was the son of Adam , who was the son of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit , returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness , <EOV> <SOV> Being forty days tempted by the devil . And in those days he ate nothing ; and when they were ended , he was afterward hungry . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said to him , If thou art the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil taking him up upon a high mountain , showed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time . <EOV> <SOV> And the devil said to him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered to me , and to whomsoever I will , I give it . <EOV> <SOV> If thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve . <EOV> <SOV> And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , If thou art the son of God , cast thyself down from hence . <EOV> <SOV> For it is written , He will give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee : <EOV> <SOV> And in their hands they will bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said to him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . <EOV> <SOV> And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the surrounding region . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified by all . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath , and stood up to read . <EOV> <SOV> And there was delivered to him the book of the prophet Isaiah . And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written , <EOV> <SOV> The spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the broken - hearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised , <EOV> <SOV> To preach the acceptable year of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to say to them , This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears . <EOV> <SOV> And all bore him testimony , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Ye will surely say to me this proverb , Physician , heal thyself : whatever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Verily I say to you , No prophet is accepted in his own country . <EOV> <SOV> But I tell you in truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the heaven was shut three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land : <EOV> <SOV> But to none of them was Elijah sent , save to Sarepta , a city of Sidon , to a woman that was a widow . <EOV> <SOV> And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian . <EOV> <SOV> And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath , <EOV> <SOV> And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong . <EOV> <SOV> But he passing through the midst of them , went away , <EOV> <SOV> And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath - days . <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power . <EOV> <SOV> And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon ; and he cried out with a loud voice , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the demon had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed , and spoke among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out . <EOV> <SOV> And the fame of him went out into every place of the surrounding country . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . And the mother of Simon 's wife was taken with a violent fever ; and they besought him for her . <EOV> <SOV> And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered to them . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases , brought them to him : and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And demons also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . And he rebuking them , suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , he departed , and went into a desert place ; and the people sought him , and came to him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also , for therefore am I sent . <EOV> <SOV> And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gennesaret . <EOV> <SOV> And saw two boats standing by the lake : but the fishermen had gone out of them , and were washing their nets . <EOV> <SOV> And he entered into one of the boats , which was Simon 's , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . And he sat down , and taught the people out of the boat . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he had left speaking , he said to Simon , Lanch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon answering said to him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing ; nevertheless , at thy word I will let down the net . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had done this , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net broke . <EOV> <SOV> And they beckoned to their partners , who were in the other boat , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the boats , so that they began to sink . <EOV> <SOV> When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord . <EOV> <SOV> For he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken : <EOV> <SOV> And so was also James and John the sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon . And Jesus said to Simon , Fear not : from henceforth thou shalt catch men . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had brought their boats to land , they forsook all , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold , a man full of leprosy : who seeing Jesus , fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : Be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and show thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded for a testimony to them . <EOV> <SOV> But so much the more a fame of him went abroad : and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities . <EOV> <SOV> And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , who had come out of every town of Galilee , and Judea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , men brought in a bed a man who was taken with the palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in , because of the multitude , they went upon the house - top , and let him down through the tiling with his couch , into the midst before Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw their faith , he said to him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this who speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins but God alone ? <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering , said to them , What reason ye in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , He said to the sick with the palsy , I say to thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he arose before them , and took up that on which he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to - day . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he went forth , and saw a publican named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said to him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And he left all , arose , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Levi made him a great feast in his own house ; and there was a great company of publicans , and of others that sat down with them . <EOV> <SOV> But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said to them , They that are well need not a physician ; but they that are sick . <EOV> <SOV> I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Can ye make the children of the bride - chamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? <EOV> <SOV> But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then they will fast in those days . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke also a parable to them : No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old : if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new , agreeth not with the old . <EOV> <SOV> And no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles will perish . <EOV> <SOV> But new wine must be put into new bottles , and both are preserved . <EOV> <SOV> No man also having drank old wine , immediately desireth new : for he saith , The old is better . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through corn - fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and ate , rubbing them in their hands . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of the Pharisees said to them , Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath - days ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering them , said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was hungry , and they who were with him ; <EOV> <SOV> How he went into the house of God , and took and ate the show - bread , and gave also to them that were with him , which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue , and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered : <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , to see whether he would heal on the sabbath ; that they might find an accusation against him . <EOV> <SOV> But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man who had the withered hand , Rise , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose , and stood forth . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath - days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ? <EOV> <SOV> And looking around upon them all , he said to the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other . <EOV> <SOV> And they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , that he went out to a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was day , he called to him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named Apostles ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon ( whom he also named Peter ) and Andrew his brother , James and John , and Philip and Bartholomew , <EOV> <SOV> Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alpheus , and Simon called Zelotes , <EOV> <SOV> And Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , who also was the traitor . <EOV> <SOV> And he came down with them , and stood in the plain ; and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judea and Jerusalem , and from the sea - coast of Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ; <EOV> <SOV> And they that were afflicted with unclean spirits : and they were healed . <EOV> <SOV> And the whole multitude sought to touch him ; for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all . <EOV> <SOV> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed are ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , on account of the son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers to the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . Woe to you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you who hear , Love your enemies , do good to them who hate you , <EOV> <SOV> Bless them that curse you , and pray for them who despitefully use you . <EOV> <SOV> And to him that smiteth thee on the one cheek , offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloke , forbid not to take thy coat also . <EOV> <SOV> Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods , ask them not again . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise . <EOV> <SOV> For if ye love them who love you , what thanks have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye do good to them who do good to you , what thanks have ye ? for sinners also do even the same . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye lend to them from whom ye hope to receive , what thanks have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much in return . <EOV> <SOV> But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil . <EOV> <SOV> Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful . <EOV> <SOV> Judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven : <EOV> <SOV> Give , and it shall be given to you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye give to others , it shall be measured to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke a parable to them ; Can the blind lead the blind ? will they not both fall into the ditch ? <EOV> <SOV> The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect , shall be as his master . <EOV> <SOV> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thy own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thy eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thy own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thy own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . <EOV> <SOV> For every tree is known by its own fruit : for from thorns men do not gather figs , nor from a bramble bush do they gather grapes . <EOV> <SOV> A good man out of the good treasure of his heart , bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart , bringeth forth that which is evil : for from the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> And why call ye me Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? <EOV> <SOV> Whoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will show you to whom he is like . <EOV> <SOV> He is like a man who built a house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock . <EOV> <SOV> But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that , without a foundation , built a house on the earth , against which the stream beat vehemently , and immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house was great . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear to him , was sick , and ready to die . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard of Jesus , he sent to him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came to Jesus , they besought him earnestly , saying , That he was worthy for whom he should do this : <EOV> <SOV> For he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying to him , Lord , trouble not thyself : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof ; <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee ; but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> For I also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say to one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus heard these things , he marveled at him , and turned himself about and said to the people that followed him , I say to you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant well that had been sick . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain : and many of his disciples went with him , and many people . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and many people of the city were with her . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said to her , Weep not . <EOV> <SOV> And he came and touched the bier : And they that bore him stood still . And he said , Young man , I say to thee , Arise . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak , and he delivered him to his mother . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a fear on all : and they glorified God , saying , That a great prophet hath risen among us ; and , That God hath visited his people . <EOV> <SOV> And this rumor of him went forth throughout all Judea , and throughout all the neighboring region . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John informed him of all these things . <EOV> <SOV> And John calling two of his disciples sent them to Jesus , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ? <EOV> <SOV> When the men had come to him , they said , John the Baptist hath sent us to thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ? <EOV> <SOV> And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities , and diseases , and of evil spirits ; and to many that were blind he gave sight . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus answering , said to them , Go , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; that the blind see , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed is he , to whom I shall not be a stumbling block . <EOV> <SOV> And when the messengers of John had departed , he began to speak to the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they who are gorgeously appareled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts . <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and much more than a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> This is he , concerning whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , Among those that are born of women , there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God , is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized by him . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , To what then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ? <EOV> <SOV> They are like children sitting in the market - place , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped to you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept . <EOV> <SOV> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread , nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a demon . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold , a gluttonous man , and a wine - bibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . <EOV> <SOV> But wisdom is justified by all her children . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down at table . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a woman in the city , who was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at table in the Pharisee 's house , brought an alabaster - box of ointment , <EOV> <SOV> And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the Pharisee who had invited him , saw it , he spoke within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who , and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him , for she is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said to him , Simon , I have somewhat to say to thee . And he saith , Master , speak . <EOV> <SOV> There was a certain creditor , who had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ? <EOV> <SOV> Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . And he said to him , Thou hast rightly judged . <EOV> <SOV> And he turned to the woman , and said to Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head . <EOV> <SOV> Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman , since the time I came in , hath not ceased to kiss my feet . <EOV> <SOV> My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore I say to thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , Thy sins are forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And they that sat at table with him , began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him , <EOV> <SOV> And certain women , who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven demons . <EOV> <SOV> And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod 's steward , and Susanna , and many others , who ministered to him of their substance . <EOV> <SOV> And when many people were collected , and had come to him out of every city , he spoke by a parable : <EOV> <SOV> A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it . <EOV> <SOV> And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered , because it lacked moisture . <EOV> <SOV> And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it . <EOV> <SOV> And other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bore fruit a hundred - fold . And when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , What doth this parable mean ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . <EOV> <SOV> Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God . <EOV> <SOV> Those by the way side , are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved . <EOV> <SOV> They on the rock are they , who , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , who for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away . <EOV> <SOV> And that which fell among thorns are they , who , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection . <EOV> <SOV> But that on the good ground are they , who in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience . <EOV> <SOV> No man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they who enter in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known , and come abroad . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come near to him for the crowd . <EOV> <SOV> And it was told to him by certain , who said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said to them , My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God , and do it . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a boat with his disciples : and he said to them , Let us go over to the other side of the lake . And they lanched forth . <EOV> <SOV> But as they sailed , he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . Then he arose , and rebuked the wind , and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Where is your faith ? And they being afraid , wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him . <EOV> <SOV> And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , who had demons a long time , and wore no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs . <EOV> <SOV> When he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I beseech thee torment me not . <EOV> <SOV> ( For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For often it had caught him , and he was kept bound with chains , and in fetters : and he broke the bands , and was driven by the demon into the wilderness . ) <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus asked him , saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : because many demons had entered into him . <EOV> <SOV> And they besought him , that he would not command them to go out into the deep . <EOV> <SOV> And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them . <EOV> <SOV> Then the demons went out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked . <EOV> <SOV> When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country . <EOV> <SOV> Then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man out of whom the demons had departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> They also who saw it , told them by what means he that was possessed by the demons was healed . <EOV> <SOV> Then the whole multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes , besought him to depart from them : for they were taken with great fear . And he went into the boat , and returned . <EOV> <SOV> Now the man out of whom the demons had departed , besought him that he might be with him . But Jesus sent him away , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Return to thy own house , and show how great things God hath done to thee . And he went away and published throughout the whole city , how great things Jesus had done to him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , when Jesus had returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at the feet of Jesus , and besought him that he would come into his house : <EOV> <SOV> For he had one daughter only , about twelve years of age , and she lay dying . ( But as he was going , the people thronged him . <EOV> <SOV> And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , who had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed by any , <EOV> <SOV> Came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Who touched me ? When all denied , Peter , and they that were with him , said , Master , the multitude throng thee , and press thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Somebody hath touched me : for I perceive that virtue hath gone out of me . <EOV> <SOV> And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared to him before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking , there cometh one from the house of the ruler of the synagogue , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead : trouble not the Master . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden . <EOV> <SOV> And all wept and bewailed her : but he said , Weep not : she is not dead , but sleepeth . <EOV> <SOV> And they derided him , knowing that she was dead . <EOV> <SOV> And he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , Maid , arise . <EOV> <SOV> And her spirit came again , and she arose immediately : and he commanded to give her food . <EOV> <SOV> And her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all demons , and to cure diseases . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staffs , nor bag , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatever house ye enter , there abide , and thence depart . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where . <EOV> <SOV> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said by some , that John had risen from the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> And by some , that Elijah had appeared ; and by others , that one of the ancient prophets had risen again . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod said , John have I beheaded ; but who is this of whom I hear such things ? And he desired to see him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles , when they had returned , told him all that they had done . And he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place , belonging to the city called Bethsaida . <EOV> <SOV> And the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spoke to them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing . <EOV> <SOV> And when the day began to decline , then came the twelve , and said to him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country around , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more than five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy provisions for all this people . <EOV> <SOV> For they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down by fifties in a company . <EOV> <SOV> And they did so , and made them all sit down . <EOV> <SOV> Then he took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and broke , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they ate , and were all satisfied : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them , twelve baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he was in retirement praying , his disciples were with him ; and he asked them , saying , Who say the people that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> They answering , said , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elijah ; and others say , that one of the ancient prophets is risen again . <EOV> <SOV> He said to them , But who say ye that I am ? Peter answering , said , Christ of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he strictly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , and chief priests , and scribes , and be put to death , and be raised the third day . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whoever will save his life , shall lose it : but whoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it . <EOV> <SOV> For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ? <EOV> <SOV> For whoever shall be ashamed of me , and of my words , of him will the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in that of his Father , and of the holy angels . <EOV> <SOV> But I tell you in truth , there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , about eight days after these sayings , he took Peter , and John , and James , and went up upon a mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistening . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there talked with him two men , who were Moses and Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> Who appeared in glory , and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah : not knowing what he said . <EOV> <SOV> While he was thus speaking , there came a cloud and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they had come down from the hill , many people met him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee look upon my son : for he is my only child . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth , and bruising him , hardly departeth from him . <EOV> <SOV> And I besought thy disciples to cast him out , and they could not . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was yet coming , the demon threw him down , and tore him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they were all wondering at all things which Jesus did , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men . <EOV> <SOV> But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him concerning that saying . <EOV> <SOV> Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him , <EOV> <SOV> And said to them , Whoever shall receive this child in my name , receiveth me ; and whoever shall receive me , receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great . <EOV> <SOV> And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out demons in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us , is for us . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> And sent messengers before his face : and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him . <EOV> <SOV> And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elijah did ? <EOV> <SOV> But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . And they went to another village . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that as they were going in the way , a certain man said to him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my house . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , No man having put his hand to the plow , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things , the Lord appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city , and place , whither he himself would come . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said he to them , The harvest truly is great , but the laborers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he would send forth laborers into his harvest . <EOV> <SOV> Go : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves . <EOV> <SOV> Carry neither purse , nor sack , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatever house ye enter , first say , Peace be to this house . <EOV> <SOV> And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the laborer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you . <EOV> <SOV> And heal the sick that are therein , and say to them , The kingdom of God is come nigh to you . <EOV> <SOV> But into whatever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go out into the streets of the same , and say , <EOV> <SOV> Even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding , be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh to you . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to thee , Chorazin ! woe to thee Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes . <EOV> <SOV> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shall be thrust down to hell . <EOV> <SOV> He that heareth you , heareth me ; and he that despiseth you , despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me , despiseth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the seventy returned with joy , saying , Lord , even the demons are subject to us through thy name . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I give to you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you . <EOV> <SOV> Notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject to you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to babes : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight . <EOV> <SOV> All things are delivered to me by my Father : and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him . <EOV> <SOV> And he turned himself to his disciples , and said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see . <EOV> <SOV> For I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and have not heard them . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> He said to him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbor as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live . <EOV> <SOV> But he , willing to justify himself , said to Jesus , And who is my neighbor ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among robbers , who stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead . <EOV> <SOV> And by chance there came down a certain priest that way ; and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came were he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him , <EOV> <SOV> And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow , when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said to him , Take care of him : and whatever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee . <EOV> <SOV> Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbor to him that fell among the robbers ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , He that showed mercy on him . Then said Jesus to him , Go , and do thou likewise . <EOV> <SOV> Now it came to pass , as they were going , he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman , named Martha , received him into her house . <EOV> <SOV> And she had a sister called Mary , who also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word . <EOV> <SOV> But Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered , and said to her , Martha , Martha , thou art anxious , and troubled about many things : <EOV> <SOV> But one thing is needful ; and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , that as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said to him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , When ye pray , say , Our Father who art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so on earth . <EOV> <SOV> Give us day by day our daily bread . <EOV> <SOV> And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go to him at midnight , and say to him , Friend , lend me three loaves : <EOV> <SOV> For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and the door shall be opened to you . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that asketh , receiveth ; and he that seeketh , findeth ; and to him that knocketh , the door shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he shall ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ? <EOV> <SOV> Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ? <EOV> <SOV> If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children : how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ? <EOV> <SOV> And he was casting out a demon , and it was dumb . And it came to pass when the demon was gone out , the dumb spoke ; and the people wondered . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them said , He casteth out demons through Beelzebub , the chief of the demons . <EOV> <SOV> And others tempting him , sought from him a sign from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth . <EOV> <SOV> If Satan also is divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub . <EOV> <SOV> And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if I with the finger of God cast out demons , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you . <EOV> <SOV> When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace : <EOV> <SOV> But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armor in which he trusted , and divideth his spoils . <EOV> <SOV> He that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth . <EOV> <SOV> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest : and finding none , he saith , I will return to my house whence I came out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished . <EOV> <SOV> Then he goeth and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he was speaking these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said to him , Blessed is the womb that bore thee , and the paps which nourished thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he said , Yes , rather blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it . <EOV> <SOV> And when the people were assembled in crowds , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of Jonah the prophet . <EOV> <SOV> For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites , so also shall the Son of man be to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth , to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , a greater than Solomon is here . <EOV> <SOV> The men of Nineveh shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , a greater than Jonah is here . <EOV> <SOV> No man when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a close vessel , but on a candlestick , that they who come in may see the light . <EOV> <SOV> The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thy eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thy eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed therefore , that the light which is in thee be not darkness . <EOV> <SOV> If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light ; as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was speaking , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to eat . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Pharisee saw it , he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said to him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness . <EOV> <SOV> Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without , make that which is within also ? <EOV> <SOV> But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and behold , all things are clean to you . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint , and rue , and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the others undone . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered one of the lawyers , and said to him , Master , thus saying , thou reproachest us also . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Woe to you also , ye lawyers , for ye load men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you ! for ye build the sepulchers of the prophets , and your fathers killed them . <EOV> <SOV> Truly ye bear testimony , that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchers . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they will slay and persecute : <EOV> <SOV> That the blood of all the prophets , which hath been shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ; <EOV> <SOV> From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias , who perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say to you , It shall be required of this generation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye have not entered in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered . <EOV> <SOV> And as he said these things to them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to solicit him to speak of many things ; <EOV> <SOV> Laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something from his mouth , that they might accuse him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In the mean time , when there was gathered an innumerable multitude of people , so that they trod one upon another , he began to say to his disciples first of all , Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy . <EOV> <SOV> For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore , whatever ye have spoken in darkness , shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets , shall be proclaimed upon the house - tops . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do . <EOV> <SOV> But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , who after he hath killed , hath power to cast into hell ; yes , I say to you , Fear him . <EOV> <SOV> Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ? <EOV> <SOV> But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> Also I say to you , Whoever shall confess me before men , him will the Son of man also confess before the angels of God . <EOV> <SOV> But he that denieth me before men , shall be denied before the angels of God . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but to him that blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And when they bring you to the synagogues , and before magistrates , and powers , be not solicitous how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say : <EOV> <SOV> For the Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the company said to him , Master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Man , who made me a judge , or a divider over you ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man 's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke a parable to them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully : <EOV> <SOV> And he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to deposit my fruits ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I deposit all my fruits and my goods . <EOV> <SOV> And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast abundance of goods laid up for many years ; take thy ease , eat , drink , and be merry . <EOV> <SOV> But God said to him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided ? <EOV> <SOV> So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich towards God . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to his disciples , Therefore I say to you , Be not anxious for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on . <EOV> <SOV> The life is more than food , and the body is more than raiment . <EOV> <SOV> Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap : which neither have store - house , nor barn ; and God feedeth them : How much more are ye better than the fowls ? <EOV> <SOV> And which of you by solicitude can add to his stature one cubit ? <EOV> <SOV> If ye then are not able to do that thing which is least , why are ye anxious for the rest ? <EOV> <SOV> Consider the lilies how they grow : They toil not , they spin not ; and yet I say to you , that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . <EOV> <SOV> If then God so clothe the grass , which is to - day in the field , and to - morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> And seek ye not what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind . <EOV> <SOV> For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things . <EOV> <SOV> But rather seek ye the kingdom of God , and all these things shall be added to you . <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> Sell what ye have , and give alms : provide yourselves bags which become not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth . <EOV> <SOV> For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . <EOV> <SOV> Let your loins be girt , and your lights burning ; <EOV> <SOV> And ye yourselves like men that wait for their lord , when he shall return from the wedding ; that , when he cometh and knocketh , they may open to him immediately . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say to you , that he will gird himself , and make them to sit down to eat , and will come forth and serve them . <EOV> <SOV> And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants . <EOV> <SOV> And this know , that if the master of the house knew at what hour the thief would come , he would watch , and not suffer his house to be broken through . <EOV> <SOV> Be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter said to him , Lord , speakest thou this parable to us , or even to all ? <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of provisions in due season ? <EOV> <SOV> Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing . <EOV> <SOV> In truth I say to you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath . <EOV> <SOV> But if that servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the men - servants , and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ? <EOV> <SOV> The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him asunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers . <EOV> <SOV> And that servant who knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes . <EOV> <SOV> But he that knew not , and committed things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . For to whomsoever much is given , of him shall much be required : and to whom men have committed much , from him they will ask the more . <EOV> <SOV> I am come to send fire on the earth , and what will I , if it is already kindled ? <EOV> <SOV> But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it shall be accomplished ! <EOV> <SOV> Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , No ; but rather division : <EOV> <SOV> For from henceforth there will be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three . <EOV> <SOV> The father will be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother - in - law against her daughter - in - law , and the daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law . <EOV> <SOV> And he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rising in the west , immediately ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it is . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye perceive the south wind blowing , ye say , There will be heat ; and it cometh to pass . <EOV> <SOV> Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky , and of the earth ; but how is it , that ye do not discern this time ? <EOV> <SOV> And why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ? <EOV> <SOV> When thou goest with thy adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he draw thee before the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison . <EOV> <SOV> I tell thee , thou shalt not depart thence , till thou hast paid the very last mite . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> There were present at that season some that told him of the Galileans , whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said to them , Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans , because they suffered such things ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , No ; but except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish . <EOV> <SOV> Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , No ; but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish . <EOV> <SOV> He spoke also this parable : A certain man had a fig - tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit on it , and found none . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig - tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answering , said to him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it : <EOV> <SOV> And if it shall bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down . <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise raise herself . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said to her , Woman , thou art loosed from thy infirmity . <EOV> <SOV> And he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God . <EOV> <SOV> And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because Jesus had healed on the sabbath , and said to the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> The Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ? <EOV> <SOV> And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , to be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he , To what is the kingdom of God like ? and to what shall I resemble it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like a grain of mustard - seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden , and it grew , and became a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it . <EOV> <SOV> And again he said , To what shall I liken the kingdom of God ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . <EOV> <SOV> And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying towards Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Then said one to him , Lord , are there few that are saved ? And he said to them , <EOV> <SOV> Strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , I say to you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able . <EOV> <SOV> When once the master of the house hath risen , and hath shut the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us ; and he will answer and say to you , I know you not whence ye are : <EOV> <SOV> Then ye will begin to say , We have eaten and drank in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets . <EOV> <SOV> But he will say , I tell you , I know you not whence ye are : depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves excluded . <EOV> <SOV> And they will come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and will sit down in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there are last , who shall be first ; and there are first who shall be last . <EOV> <SOV> The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying to him , Go out , and depart hence ; for Herod will kill thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Go ye and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out demons , and I do cures to - day and to - morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless , I must walk to - day and to - morrow , and the day following : for it can not be that a prophet should perish out of Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent to thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children , as a hen gathereth her brood under her wings , and ye would not ! <EOV> <SOV> Behold , your house is left to you desolate . And verily I say to you , ye shall not see me , until the time shall come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath , that they watched him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And they held their peace . And he took him and healed him , and let him go ; <EOV> <SOV> And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not forthwith pull him out on the sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> And they could not answer him again to these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he put forth a parable to those who were invited , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying to them , <EOV> <SOV> When thou art invited by any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room , lest a more honorable man than thou be invited by him ; <EOV> <SOV> And he that invited thee and him , shall come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou art invited , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that invited thee cometh , he may say to thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have honor in the presence of them that sit at table with thee . <EOV> <SOV> For whoever exalteth himself shall be abased , and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he also to him that invited him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbors ; lest they also invite thee again , and a recompense be made thee . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind : <EOV> <SOV> And thou shalt be blessed : for they can not recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just . <EOV> <SOV> And when one of them that sat at table with him heard these things , he said to him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to him , A certain man made a great supper , and invited many : <EOV> <SOV> And sent his servant at supper - time , to say to them that were invited , Come , for all things are now ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said to him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused . <EOV> <SOV> And another said , I have married a wife : and therefore I can not come . <EOV> <SOV> So that servant came , and showed his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry , said to his servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind . <EOV> <SOV> And the servant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord said to the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , that none of those men who were invited , shall taste my supper . <EOV> <SOV> And there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said to them , <EOV> <SOV> If any man cometh to me , and hateth not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yes , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> For which of you intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he hath sufficient to finish it ? <EOV> <SOV> Lest perhaps after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish . <EOV> <SOV> Or what king going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ? <EOV> <SOV> Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an embassy , and desireth conditions of peace . <EOV> <SOV> So likewise , whoever he is of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> Salt is good : but if the salt hath lost its savor , with what shall it be seasoned ? <EOV> <SOV> It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill , but men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then drew near to him all the publicans and sinners to hear him . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke this parable to them , saying , <EOV> <SOV> What man of you having a hundred sheep , if he loseth one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he findeth it ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing . <EOV> <SOV> And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbors , saying to them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , who need no repentance . <EOV> <SOV> Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she loseth one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she findeth it ? <EOV> <SOV> And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbors together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise , I say to you , There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A certain man had two sons : <EOV> <SOV> And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . And he divided to them his living . <EOV> <SOV> And not many days after , the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had spent all , there arose a severe famine in that land ; and he began to be in want . <EOV> <SOV> And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine . <EOV> <SOV> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat ; and no man gave to him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father have bread enough and to spare , and I am perishing with hunger ! <EOV> <SOV> I will arise and go to my father , and will say to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee , <EOV> <SOV> And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And the son said to him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son . <EOV> <SOV> But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him , and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet : <EOV> <SOV> And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry : <EOV> <SOV> For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry . <EOV> <SOV> Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing . <EOV> <SOV> And he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him in health . <EOV> <SOV> And he was angry , and would not go in ; therefore his father came out , and entreated him . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering , said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither have I at any time transgressed thy commandment ; and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends : <EOV> <SOV> But as soon as this thy son had come , who hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Son , thou art ever with me : and all that I have is thine . <EOV> <SOV> It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said also to his disciples , There was a certain rich man who had a steward ; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods . <EOV> <SOV> And he called him , and said to him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship : for thou mayest be no longer steward . <EOV> <SOV> Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh from me the stewardship : I can not dig ; I am ashamed to beg . <EOV> <SOV> I am resolved what to do , that when I am removed from the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses . <EOV> <SOV> So he called every one of his lord 's debtors , and said to the first , How much owest thou to my lord ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , A hundred measures of oil . And he said to him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , A hundred measures of wheat . And he said to him , Take thy bill , and write eighty . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations . <EOV> <SOV> He that is faithful in that which is least , is faithful also in much ; and he that is unjust in the least , is unjust also in much . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ? <EOV> <SOV> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man 's , who will give you that which is your own ? <EOV> <SOV> No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things , and they derided him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Ye are they who justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men , is abomination in the sight of God . <EOV> <SOV> The law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it . <EOV> <SOV> And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away , than one tittle of the law to fail . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery ; and whoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband , committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> There was a certain rich man , who was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day : <EOV> <SOV> And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , who was laid at his gate , full of sores , <EOV> <SOV> And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover , the dogs came and licked his sores . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by angels into Abraham 's bosom . The rich man also died , and was buried : <EOV> <SOV> And in hell he lifted up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom . <EOV> <SOV> And he cried , and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue : for I am tormented in this flame . <EOV> <SOV> But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy life - time receivedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented . <EOV> <SOV> And besides all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they who would pass from hence to you , can not ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldst send him to my father 's house : <EOV> <SOV> For I have five brethren ; that he may testify to them , lest they also come into this place of torment . <EOV> <SOV> Abraham saith to him , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , No , father Abraham : but if one shall go to them from the dead , they will repent . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one shall rise from the dead . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then he said to the disciples , It is impossible but that causes of sin will come : but woe to him by whom they come ! <EOV> <SOV> It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should cause one of these little ones to fall into sin . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother shall trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he shall repent forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And if he shall trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day shall turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles said to the Lord , Increase our faith . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard - seed , ye might say to this sycamine - tree , Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it would obey you . <EOV> <SOV> But which of you having a servant plowing , or feeding cattle , will say to him immediately , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> And will not rather say to him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drank ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> Doth he thank that servant , because he did the things that were commanded him ? I suppose not . <EOV> <SOV> So likewise ye , when ye shall have done all the things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which it was our duty to do . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , who stood at a distance . <EOV> <SOV> And they lifted up their voices , and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw them , he said to them , Go , show yourselves to the priests . And it came to pass , that as they were going , they were cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God , <EOV> <SOV> And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ? <EOV> <SOV> There are not found returning to give glory to God , save this stranger . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Arise , depart : thy faith hath made thee whole . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was asked by the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation . <EOV> <SOV> Neither will they say , Lo here ! or lo there ! for behold , the kingdom of God is within you . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to his disciples , The days will come , when ye will desire to see one of the days of the son of man , and ye shall not see it . <EOV> <SOV> And they will say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them . <EOV> <SOV> For as the lightning that lighteneth from the one part under heaven , shineth to the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day . <EOV> <SOV> But first he must suffer many things , and be rejected by this generation . <EOV> <SOV> And as it was in the days of Noah , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> They ate , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark ; and the flood came , and destroyed them all . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot : they ate , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they built ; <EOV> <SOV> But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom , it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all : <EOV> <SOV> Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed . <EOV> <SOV> In that day , he who shall be upon the house - top , and his furniture in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back . <EOV> <SOV> Remember Lot 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever shall seek to save his life , shall lose it ; and whoever shall lose his life , shall preserve it . <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , in that night there will be two men in one bed ; the one will be taken , and the other will be left . <EOV> <SOV> Two women will be grinding together ; the one will be taken , and the other left . <EOV> <SOV> Two men will be in the field ; the one will be taken , and the other left . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered and said to him , Where Lord ? And he said to them , Wherever the body is , thither will the eagles be collected . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he spoke a parable to them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ; <EOV> <SOV> Saying , There was in a city a judge , who feared not God , neither regarded man . <EOV> <SOV> And there was a widow in that city ; and she came to him , saying , Avenge me of my adversary . <EOV> <SOV> And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ; <EOV> <SOV> Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith . <EOV> <SOV> And will not God avenge his own elect , who cry day and night to him , though he beareth long with them ? <EOV> <SOV> I tell you that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless , when the Son of man cometh , will he find faith on the earth ? <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke this parable to certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others : <EOV> <SOV> Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican . <EOV> <SOV> I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all that I possess . <EOV> <SOV> And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought to him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus called them to him , and said , Suffer little children to come to me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , shall in no wise enter into it . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Why callest thou me good ?   none is good , save one , that is God . <EOV> <SOV> Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honor thy father and thy mother . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , All these have I kept from my youth . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus heard these things , he said to him , Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly will they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And they that heard it , said , Who then can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> Then he said , The things which are impossible with men , are possible with God . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter said , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Verily I say to you , there is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children for the sake of the kingdom of God , <EOV> <SOV> Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting . <EOV> <SOV> Then he took the twelve , and said to them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished . <EOV> <SOV> For he will be delivered to the Gentiles , and will be mocked , and spitefully treated , and spitted on ; <EOV> <SOV> And they will scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he will rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that as he had come nigh to Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging ; <EOV> <SOV> And hearing the multitude passing by , he asked what it meant . <EOV> <SOV> And they told him , that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by . <EOV> <SOV> And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And they who went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , Thou son of David , have mercy on me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood and commanded him to be brought to him : and when he had come near , he asked him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , What wilt thou that I shall do to thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise to God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a man named Zaccheus , who was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich . <EOV> <SOV> And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the crowd , because he was little of stature . <EOV> <SOV> And he ran before , and climbed up upon a sycamore - tree to see him ; for he was to pass that way . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said to him , Zaccheus , make haste , and come down : for to - day I must abide at thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> And Zaccheus stood , and said to the Lord ; Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him four - fold . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , This day is salvation come to this house , forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> And as they heard these things , he added and spoke a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return . <EOV> <SOV> And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said to them , Occupy till I come . <EOV> <SOV> But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that when he had returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called to him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities . <EOV> <SOV> And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds . <EOV> <SOV> And he said likewise to him , Be thou also over five cities . <EOV> <SOV> And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin : <EOV> <SOV> For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up what thou layedst not down , and reapest what thou didst not sow . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to him , Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest me to be an austere man , taking up what I laid not down , and reaping what I did not sow : <EOV> <SOV> Why then gavest thou not my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required my own with interest ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds . <EOV> <SOV> ( And they said to him , Lord , he hath ten pounds . ) <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , That to every one who hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even what he hath shall be taken away from him . <EOV> <SOV> But those my enemies , who would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending towards Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when he had come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in which at your entering ye will find a colt tied , on which yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man shall ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say to him , Because the Lord hath need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were sent , went and found even as he had said to them . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were loosing the colt , the owners of it said to them , Why loose ye the colt ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , The Lord hath need of him . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice , for all the mighty works that they had seen . <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : Peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him , Master , rebuke thy disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said to them , I tell you , that if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong to thy peace ! but now they are hid from thy eyes . <EOV> <SOV> For the days shall come upon thee , that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and encompass thee , and keep thee in on every side , <EOV> <SOV> And shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee : and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another : because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation . <EOV> <SOV> And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold in it , and them that bought , <EOV> <SOV> Saying to them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer , but ye have made it a den of thieves . <EOV> <SOV> And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests , and the scribes , and the chief of the people sought to destroy him , <EOV> <SOV> And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he was teaching the people in the temple , and preaching the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him , with the elders , <EOV> <SOV> And spoke to him , saying , Tell us , By what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said to them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me : <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or from men ? <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ? <EOV> <SOV> But if we say , From men ; all the people will stone us : for they are persuaded that John was a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> Then he began to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time . <EOV> <SOV> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and treated him shamefully , and sent him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> And again he sent the third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be when they see him they will reverence him . <EOV> <SOV> But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . <EOV> <SOV> So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them ? <EOV> <SOV> He will come and destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , may that never be . <EOV> <SOV> And he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ? <EOV> <SOV> Whoever shall fall upon that stone , shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them . <EOV> <SOV> And they watched him , and sent forth spies , who should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly : <EOV> <SOV> Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Cesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But he perceived their craftiness , and said to them , Why tempt ye me ? <EOV> <SOV> Show me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered and said , Cesar 's . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Render therefore to Cesar the things which are Cesar 's , and to God the things which are God 's . <EOV> <SOV> And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marveled at his answer , and held their peace . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him certain of the Sadducees ( who deny that there is any resurrection ) and they asked him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Master , Moses wrote to us , If any man 's brother should die , having a wife , and he should die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> There were therefore seven brothers : and the first took a wife , and died without children . <EOV> <SOV> And the second took her for a wife , and he died childless . <EOV> <SOV> And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : And they left no children , and died . <EOV> <SOV> Last of all the woman died also . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore in the resurrection , whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering , said to them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage : <EOV> <SOV> But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage . <EOV> <SOV> Neither can they die any more : for they are equal to the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection . <EOV> <SOV> Now that the dead are raised , even Moses showed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . <EOV> <SOV> For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living : for all live to him . <EOV> <SOV> Then certain of the scribes answering , said , Master , thou hast well said . <EOV> <SOV> And after that , they durst not ask him any question at all . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , How say they that Christ is David 's son ? <EOV> <SOV> And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The LORD said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , <EOV> <SOV> Till I make thy enemies thy footstool . <EOV> <SOV> David therefore calleth him Lord , how is he then his son ? <EOV> <SOV> Then in the audience of all the people , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Beware of the scribes , who desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ; <EOV> <SOV> Who devour widows ' houses , and for a show make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he looked up , and saw rich men casting their gifts into the treasury . <EOV> <SOV> And he saw also a certain poor widow , casting in thither two mites . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Of a truth I say to you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all . <EOV> <SOV> For all these have of their abundance cast in to the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had . <EOV> <SOV> And as some spoke of the temple , that it was adorned with goodly stones , and gifts , he said , <EOV> <SOV> As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that will not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , saying , Master , but when will these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Take heed that ye be not deceived : for many will come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and the time draweth near : therefore go ye not after them . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye shall hear of wars , and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass : but the end is not immediately . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to them , Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : <EOV> <SOV> And great earthquakes will be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences : and fearful sights , and great signs will there be from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But before all these they will lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> And it shall turn to you for a testimony . <EOV> <SOV> Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer . <EOV> <SOV> For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsmen , and friends ; and some of you will they cause to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will be hated by all men for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> But there shall not a hair of your head perish . <EOV> <SOV> In your patience possess ye your souls . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that its desolation is nigh . <EOV> <SOV> Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains ; and let them who are in the midst of it depart from it ; and let not them that are in the countries enter into it . <EOV> <SOV> For these are the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to them that are with child , and to them that nurse infants in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people . <EOV> <SOV> And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ; <EOV> <SOV> Men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for apprehension of those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud , with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads : for your redemption draweth nigh . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke to them a parable ; Behold the fig - tree , and all the trees ; <EOV> <SOV> When they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your ownselves that summer is now nigh at hand . <EOV> <SOV> So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , This generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my word shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> And take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares . <EOV> <SOV> For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth . <EOV> <SOV> Watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> And in the day - time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , to hear him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him : for they feared the people . <EOV> <SOV> Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And he went , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him to them . <EOV> <SOV> And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money . <EOV> <SOV> And he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him to them in the absence of the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare for us the passover , that we may eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Behold , when ye have entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall say to the master of the house , The Master saith to thee , Where is the guest - chamber , where I may eat the passover with my disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And he will show you a large upper room furnished : there make ready . <EOV> <SOV> And they went and found as he had said to them : and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , I will not any more eat of it until it shall be fulfilled in the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come . <EOV> <SOV> And he took bread , and gave thanks , and broke it , and gave to them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you . <EOV> <SOV> But behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table . <EOV> <SOV> And truly the Son of man goeth as it was determined : but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed ! <EOV> <SOV> And they began to inquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing . <EOV> <SOV> And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them , are called benefactors . <EOV> <SOV> But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve . <EOV> <SOV> For which is greater , he that sitteth at table , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at table ? but I am among you as he that serveth . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are they who have continued with me in my temptations . <EOV> <SOV> And I appoint to you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed to me ; <EOV> <SOV> That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat : <EOV> <SOV> But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not ; and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Lord , I am ready to go with thee both into prison , and to death . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock will not crow this day , before thou wilt thrice deny that thou knowest me . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , When I sent you without purse , and sack , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to them , But now he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his sack : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , that this which is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said to them , It is enough . <EOV> <SOV> And he came out , and went , as he was wo nt , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was at the place , he said to them , Pray , that ye enter not into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone 's cast , and kneeled down , and prayed . <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Father , if thou art willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine be done . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared to him an angel from heaven , strengthening him . <EOV> <SOV> And being in an agony , he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And when he arose from prayer , and had come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow : <EOV> <SOV> And said to them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was yet speaking , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near to Jesus to kiss him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ? <EOV> <SOV> When they who were about him , saw what would follow , they said to him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ? <EOV> <SOV> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said to the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders who had come to him , Are ye come out as against a thief , with swords and staffs ? <EOV> <SOV> When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . <EOV> <SOV> Then they took him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest 's house . And Peter followed at a distance . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him . <EOV> <SOV> And he denied him , saying , Woman , I know him not . <EOV> <SOV> And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou art also of them . And Peter said , Man , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> And about the space of one hour after , another confidently affirmed , saying , In truth this man also was with him ; for he is a Galilean . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he was yet speaking , the cock crowed . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said to him , Before the cock shall crow , thou wilt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter went out , and wept bitterly . <EOV> <SOV> And the men that held Jesus , mocked him , and smote him . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And many other things blasphemously they spoke against him . <EOV> <SOV> And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people , and the chief priests , and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Art thou the Christ ? tell us . And he said to them , If I tell you , ye will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go . <EOV> <SOV> Hereafter will the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said to them , Ye say that I am . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , What need have we of any further testimony ? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the whole multitude of them arose , and led him to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this man perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar , saying , that he himself is Christ a king . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said , Thou sayest it . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Pilate to the chief priests , and to the people , I find no fault in this man . <EOV> <SOV> And they were the more fierce , saying , He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Judea , beginning from Galilee to this place . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man was a Galilean . <EOV> <SOV> And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time . <EOV> <SOV> And when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he had been for a long time , desirous to see him , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him . <EOV> <SOV> Then he questioned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod with his troops set him at naught , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate . <EOV> <SOV> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together ; for before they were at enmity between themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests , and the rulers , and the people , <EOV> <SOV> Said to them , Ye have brought this man to me , as one that perverteth the people : and behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man , touching those things of which ye accuse him ; <EOV> <SOV> No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and lo , nothing worthy of death is done to him : <EOV> <SOV> I will therefore chastise him , and release him . <EOV> <SOV> ( For of necessity he must release one to them at the feast . ) <EOV> <SOV> And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release to us Barabbas : <EOV> <SOV> ( Who , for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . ) <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore , willing to release Jesus , spoke again to them . <EOV> <SOV> But they cried , saying , Crucify , crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of death in him ; I will therefore chastise him , and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> And they were urgent with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified : and the voices of them , and of the chief priests prevailed . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required . <EOV> <SOV> And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will . <EOV> <SOV> And as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And there followed him a great company of people , and of women , who also bewailed and lamented him . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus turning to them , said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children . <EOV> <SOV> For behold , the days are coming , in which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bore , and the breasts which never nourished infants . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us . <EOV> <SOV> For if they do these things in a green tree , what will be done in the dry ? <EOV> <SOV> And two others , who were malefactors , were led with him to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come to the place which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors ; one on the right hand , and the other on the left . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus , Father , forgive them : for they know not what they do . And they parted his raiment , and cast lots . <EOV> <SOV> And the people stood beholding . And the rulers also with them derided him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if he is Christ the chosen of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , If thou art the King of the Jews , save thyself . <EOV> <SOV> And a superscription also was written over him , in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> And one of the malefactors , who were hanged , railed on him , saying , If thou art Christ , save thyself and us . <EOV> <SOV> But the other answering , rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ? <EOV> <SOV> And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to Jesus , Lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Verily I say to thee , This day shalt thou be with me in paradise . <EOV> <SOV> And it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the land until the ninth hour . <EOV> <SOV> And the sun was darkened , and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus , he expired . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned . <EOV> <SOV> And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood afar off beholding these things . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counselor : and he was a good man , and a just : <EOV> <SOV> ( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ) he was of Arimathea , a city of the Jews ; who also himself waited for the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> This man went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulcher that was hewn in stone , in which man was never before laid . <EOV> <SOV> And that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on . <EOV> <SOV> And the women also , who came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulcher , and how his body was laid . <EOV> <SOV> And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested on the sabbath , according to the commandment . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came to the sepulcher , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them . <EOV> <SOV> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> And they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed at this , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said to them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ? <EOV> <SOV> He is not here , but is risen . Remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again . <EOV> <SOV> And they remembered his words , <EOV> <SOV> And returned from the sepulcher , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest . <EOV> <SOV> It was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , who told these things to the apostles . <EOV> <SOV> And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter arose , and ran to the sepulcher , and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which had come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about sixty furlongs . <EOV> <SOV> And they talked together of all these things which had happened . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that , while they communed together , and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them . <EOV> <SOV> But their eyes were held , that they should not know him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ? <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering , said to him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these days ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What things ? And they said to him , Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God , and all the people : <EOV> <SOV> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and crucified him . <EOV> <SOV> But we trusted that it had been he who would have redeemed Israel : and besides all this , to - day is the third day since these things were done . <EOV> <SOV> Yes , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , who were early at the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> And when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , who said that he was alive . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of them who were with us , went to the sepulcher , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not . <EOV> <SOV> Then he said to them , O fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ! <EOV> <SOV> Ought not Christ to suffer these things , and to enter into his glory ? <EOV> <SOV> And beginning at Moses , and all the prophets , he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself . <EOV> <SOV> And they drew nigh to the village whither they were going : and he made as though he would go further . <EOV> <SOV> But they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is towards evening , and the day is far spent . And he went in to tarry with them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he sat at table with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and broke , and gave to them . <EOV> <SOV> And their eyes were opened , and they knew him : and he vanished out of their sight . <EOV> <SOV> And they said one to another , Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ? <EOV> <SOV> And they rose the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven assembled , and them that were with them , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon . <EOV> <SOV> And they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known to them in breaking of bread . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were thus speaking , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith to them , Peace be to you . <EOV> <SOV> But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , he showed them his hands and his feet . <EOV> <SOV> And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said to them , Have ye here any thing for food ? <EOV> <SOV> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and a honey - comb . <EOV> <SOV> And he took it , and ate before them . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , These are the words which I spoke to you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me . <EOV> <SOV> Then he opened their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures , <EOV> <SOV> And said to them , Thus it is written , and thus it behooved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day : <EOV> <SOV> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And ye are witnesses of these things . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye are endued with power from on high . <EOV> <SOV> And he led them out as far as to Bethany : and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while he was blessing them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they worshiped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy : <EOV> <SOV> And were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
