<SOC> <SOV> In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . <EOV> <SOV> The same was in the beginning with God . <EOV> <SOV> All things were made through him ; and without him was not anything made that hath been made . <EOV> <SOV> In him was life ; and the life was the light of men . <EOV> <SOV> And the light shineth in the darkness ; and the darkness apprehended it not . <EOV> <SOV> There came a man , sent from God , whose name was John . <EOV> <SOV> The same came for witness , that he might bear witness of the light , that all might believe through him . <EOV> <SOV> He was not the light , but ' came ' that he might bear witness of the light . <EOV> <SOV> There was the true light , ' even the light ' which lighteth every man , coming into the world . <EOV> <SOV> He was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world knew him not . <EOV> <SOV> He came unto his own , and they that were his own received him not . <EOV> <SOV> But as many as received him , to them gave he the right to become children of God , ' even ' to them that believe on his name : <EOV> <SOV> who were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the Word became flesh , and dwelt among us ( and we beheld his glory , glory as of the only begotten from the Father ) , full of grace and truth . <EOV> <SOV> John beareth witness of him , and crieth , saying , This was he of whom I said , He that cometh after me is become before me : for he was before me . <EOV> <SOV> For of his fulness we all received , and grace for grace . <EOV> <SOV> For the law was given through Moses ; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ . <EOV> <SOV> No man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared ' him ' . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the witness of John , when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him , Who art thou ? <EOV> <SOV> And he confessed , and denied not ; and he confessed , I am not the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elijah ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou the prophet ? And he answered , No . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said Isaiah the prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they had been sent from the Pharisees . <EOV> <SOV> And they asked him , and said unto him , Why then baptizest thou , if thou art not the Christ , neither Elijah , neither the prophet ? <EOV> <SOV> John answered them , saying , I baptize in water : in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not , <EOV> <SOV> ' even ' he that cometh after me , the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose . <EOV> <SOV> These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan , where John was baptizing . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold , the Lamb of God , that taketh away the sin of the world ! <EOV> <SOV> This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man who is become before me : for he was before me . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew him not ; but that he should be made manifest to Israel , for this cause came I baptizing in water . <EOV> <SOV> And John bare witness , saying , I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven ; and it abode upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize in water , he said unto me , Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and abiding upon him , the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And I have seen , and have borne witness that this is the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Again on the morrow John was standing , and two of his disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> and he looked upon Jesus as he walked , and saith , Behold , the Lamb of God ! <EOV> <SOV> And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus turned , and beheld them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? And they said unto him , Rabbi ( which is to say , being interpreted , Teacher ) , where abideth thou ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto them , Come , and ye shall see . They came therefore and saw where he abode ; and they abode with him that day : it was about the tenth hour . <EOV> <SOV> One of the two that heard John ' speak ' , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother . <EOV> <SOV> He findeth first his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messiah ( which is , being interpreted , Christ ) . <EOV> <SOV> He brought him unto Jesus . Jesus looked upon him , and said , Thou art Simon the son of John : thou shalt be called Cephas ( which is by interpretation , Peter ) . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee , and he findeth Philip : and Jesus saith unto him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> Now Philip was from Bethsaida , of the city of Andrew and Peter . <EOV> <SOV> Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> And Nathanael said unto him , Can any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold , an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile ! <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael saith unto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee . <EOV> <SOV> Nathanael answered him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art King of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee underneath the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye shall see the heaven opened , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there : <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus also was bidden , and his disciples , to the marriage . <EOV> <SOV> And when the wine failed , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews ' manner of purifying , containing two or three firkins apiece . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the ruler of the feast . And they bare it . <EOV> <SOV> And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine , and knew not whence it was ( but the servants that had drawn the water knew ) , the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom , <EOV> <SOV> and saith unto him , Every man setteth on first the good wine ; and when ' men ' have drunk freely , ' then ' that which is worse : thou hast kept the good wine until now . <EOV> <SOV> This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested his glory ; and his disciples believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and ' his ' brethren , and his disciples ; and there they abode not many days . <EOV> <SOV> And the passover of the Jews was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting : <EOV> <SOV> and he made a scourge of cords , and cast all out of the temple , both the sheep and the oxen ; and he poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew their tables ; <EOV> <SOV> and to them that sold the doves he said , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house a house of merchandise . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples remembered that it was written , Zeal for thy house shall eat me up . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore answered and said unto him , What sign showest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou raise it up in three days ? <EOV> <SOV> But he spake of the temple of his body . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he spake this ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , during the feast , many believed on his name , beholding his signs which he did . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus did not trust himself unto them , for that he knew all men , <EOV> <SOV> and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man ; for he himself knew what was in man . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now there was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews : <EOV> <SOV> the same came unto him by night , and said to him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God ; for no one can do these signs that thou doest , except God be with him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except one be born anew , he can not see the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except one be born of water and the Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God ! <EOV> <SOV> That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born anew . <EOV> <SOV> The wind bloweth where it will , and thou hearest the voice thereof , but knowest not whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou the teacher of Israel , and understandest not these things ? <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that which we know , and bear witness of that which we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness . <EOV> <SOV> If I told you earthly things and ye believe not , how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things ? <EOV> <SOV> And no one hath ascended into heaven , but he that descended out of heaven , ' even ' the Son of man , who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up ; <EOV> <SOV> that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth on him should not perish , but have eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world ; but that the world should be saved through him . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on him is not judged : he that believeth not hath been judged already , because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the judgment , that the light is come into the world , and men loved the darkness rather than the light ; for their works were evil . <EOV> <SOV> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , and cometh not to the light , lest his works should be reproved . <EOV> <SOV> But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light , that his works may be made manifest , that they have been wrought in God . <EOV> <SOV> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized . <EOV> <SOV> And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized . <EOV> <SOV> For John was not yet cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John 's disciples with a Jew about purifying . <EOV> <SOV> And they came unto John , and said to him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond the Jordan , to whom thou hast borne witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him . <EOV> <SOV> John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it have been given him from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but , that I am sent before him . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , that standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is made full . <EOV> <SOV> He must increase , but I must decrease . <EOV> <SOV> He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is of the earth , and of the earth he speaketh : he that cometh from heaven is above all . <EOV> <SOV> What he hath seen and heard , of that he beareth witness ; and no man receiveth his witness . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to ' this ' , that God is true . <EOV> <SOV> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for he giveth not the Spirit by measure . <EOV> <SOV> The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life ; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life , but the wrath of God abideth on him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John <EOV> <SOV> ( although Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples ) , <EOV> <SOV> he left Judea , and departed again into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And he must needs pass through Samaria . <EOV> <SOV> So he cometh to a city of Samaria , called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph : <EOV> <SOV> and Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus by the well . It was about the sixth hour . <EOV> <SOV> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink . <EOV> <SOV> For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food . <EOV> <SOV> The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , who am a Samaritan woman ? ( For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans . ) <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : whence then hast thou that living water ? <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his sons , and his cattle ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto her , Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again : <EOV> <SOV> but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come all the way hither to draw . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither . <EOV> <SOV> The woman answered and said unto him , I have no husband . Jesus saith unto her , Thou saidst well , I have no husband : <EOV> <SOV> for thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : this hast thou said truly . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when neither in this mountain , nor in Jerusalem , shall ye worship the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Ye worship that which ye know not : we worship that which we know ; for salvation is from the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth : for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers . <EOV> <SOV> God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth . <EOV> <SOV> The woman saith unto him , I know that Messiah cometh ( he that is called Christ ) : when he is come , he will declare unto us all things . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am ' he ' . <EOV> <SOV> And upon this came his disciples ; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman ; yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why speakest thou with her ? <EOV> <SOV> So the woman left her waterpot , and went away into the city , and saith to the people , <EOV> <SOV> Come , see a man , who told me all things that ' ever ' I did : can this be the Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> They went out of the city , and were coming to him . <EOV> <SOV> In the mean while the disciples prayed him , saying , Rabbi , eat . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples therefore said one to another , Hath any man brought him ' aught ' to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to accomplish his work . <EOV> <SOV> Say not ye , There are yet four months , and ' then ' cometh the harvest ? behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields , that they are white already unto harvest . <EOV> <SOV> He that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal ; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together . <EOV> <SOV> For herein is the saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth . <EOV> <SOV> I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored : others have labored , and ye are entered into their labor . <EOV> <SOV> And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman , who testified , He told me all things that ' ever ' I did . <EOV> <SOV> So when the Samaritans came unto him , they besought him to abide with them : and he abode there two days . <EOV> <SOV> And many more believed because of his word ; <EOV> <SOV> and they said to the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy speaking : for we have heard for ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world . <EOV> <SOV> And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honor in his own country . <EOV> <SOV> So when he came into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast . <EOV> <SOV> He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought ' him ' that he would come down , and heal his son ; for he was at the point of death . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will in no wise believe . <EOV> <SOV> The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him , and he went his way . <EOV> <SOV> And as he was now going down , his servants met him , saying , that his son lived . <EOV> <SOV> So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend . They said therefore unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him . <EOV> <SOV> So the father knew that ' it was ' at that hour in which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house . <EOV> <SOV> This is again the second sign that Jesus did , having come out of Judaea into Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep ' gate ' a pool , which is called in Hebrew Bethesda , having five porches . <EOV> <SOV> In these lay a multitude of them that were sick , blind , halt , withered , ' waiting for the moving of the water . ' <EOV> <SOV> ' for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole , with whatsoever disease he was holden . ' <EOV> <SOV> And a certain man was there , who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus saw him lying , and knew that he had been now a long time ' in that case ' , he saith unto him , Wouldest thou be made whole ? <EOV> <SOV> The sick man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Arise , take up thy bed , and walk . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway the man was made whole , and took up his bed and walked . Now it was the sabbath on that day . <EOV> <SOV> So the Jews said unto him that was cured , It is the sabbath , and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk . <EOV> <SOV> They asked him , Who is the man that said unto thee , Take up ' thy bed ' , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But he that was healed knew not who it was ; for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in the place . <EOV> <SOV> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing befall thee . <EOV> <SOV> The man went away , and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole . <EOV> <SOV> And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus , because he did these things on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh even until now , and I work . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only brake the sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father doing : for what things soever he doeth , these the Son also doeth in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> For the Father loveth the Son , and showeth him all things that himself doeth : and greater works than these will he show him , that ye may marvel . <EOV> <SOV> For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life , even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will . <EOV> <SOV> For neither doth the Father judge any man , but he hath given all judgment unto the Son ; <EOV> <SOV> that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . He that honoreth not the Son honoreth not the Father that sent him . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth him that sent me , hath eternal life , and cometh not into judgment , but hath passed out of death into life . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour cometh , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God ; and they that hear shall live . <EOV> <SOV> For as the Father hath life in himself , even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself : <EOV> <SOV> and he gave him authority to execute judgment , because he is a son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Marvel not at this : for the hour cometh , in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice , <EOV> <SOV> and shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of judgment . <EOV> <SOV> I can of myself do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is righteous ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true . <EOV> <SOV> It is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have sent unto John , and he hath borne witness unto the truth . <EOV> <SOV> But the witness which I receive is not from man : howbeit I say these things , that ye may be saved . <EOV> <SOV> He was the lamp that burneth and shineth ; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light . <EOV> <SOV> But the witness which I have is greater than ' that of ' John ; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish , the very works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And the Father that sent me , he hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form . <EOV> <SOV> And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he sent , him ye believe not . <EOV> <SOV> Ye search the scriptures , because ye think that in them ye have eternal life ; and these are they which bear witness of me ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye will not come to me , that ye may have life . <EOV> <SOV> I receive not glory from men . <EOV> <SOV> But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive . <EOV> <SOV> How can ye believe , who receive glory one of another , and the glory that ' cometh ' from the only God ye seek not ? <EOV> <SOV> Think not that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , ' even ' Moses , on whom ye have set your hope . <EOV> <SOV> For if ye believed Moses , ye would believe me ; for he wrote of me . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ? <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee , which is ' the sea ' of Tiberias . <EOV> <SOV> And a great multitude followed him , because they beheld the signs which he did on them that were sick . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went up into the mountain , and there he sat with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Now the passover , the feast of the Jews , was at hand . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him , saith unto Philip , Whence are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? <EOV> <SOV> And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do . <EOV> <SOV> Philip answered him , Two hundred shillings ' worth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one may take a little . <EOV> <SOV> One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , saith unto him , <EOV> <SOV> There is a lad here , who hath five barley loaves , and two fishes : but what are these among so many ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said , Make the people sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore took the loaves ; and having given thanks , he distributed to them that were set down ; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were filled , he saith unto his disciples , Gather up the broken pieces which remain over , that nothing be lost . <EOV> <SOV> So they gathered them up , and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves , which remained over unto them that had eaten . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the people saw the sign which he did , they said , This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again into the mountain himself alone . <EOV> <SOV> And when evening came , his disciples went down unto the sea ; <EOV> <SOV> and they entered into a boat , and were going over the sea unto Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them . <EOV> <SOV> And the sea was rising by reason of a great wind that blew . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they behold Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the boat : and they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat : and straightway the boat was at the land whither they were going . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there , save one , and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the boat , but ' that ' his disciples went away alone <EOV> <SOV> ( howbeit there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks ) : <EOV> <SOV> when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they themselves got into the boats , and came to Capernaum , seeking Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And when they found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw signs , but because ye ate of the loaves , and were filled . <EOV> <SOV> Work not for the food which perisheth , but for the food which abideth unto eternal life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him the Father , even God , hath sealed . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , What must we do , that we may work the works of God ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , What then doest thou for a sign , that we may see , and believe thee ? what workest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness ; as it is written , He gave them bread out of heaven to eat . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , It was not Moses that gave you the bread out of heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For the bread of God is that which cometh down out of heaven , and giveth life unto the world . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them . I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall not hunger , and he that believeth on me shall never thirst . <EOV> <SOV> But I said unto you , that ye have seen me , and yet believe not . <EOV> <SOV> All that which the Father giveth me shall come unto me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out . <EOV> <SOV> For I am come down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And this is the will of him that sent me , that of all that which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For this is the will of my Father , that every one that beholdeth the Son , and believeth on him , should have eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore murmured concerning him , because he said , I am the bread which came down out of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how doth he now say , I am come down out of heaven ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> No man can come to me , except the Father that sent me draw him : and I will raise him up in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> It is written in the prophets , And they shall all be taught of God . Every one that hath heard from the Father , and hath learned , cometh unto me . <EOV> <SOV> Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he that is from God , he hath seen the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth hath eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> I am the bread of life . <EOV> <SOV> Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness , and they died . <EOV> <SOV> This is the bread which cometh down out of heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die . <EOV> <SOV> I am the living bread which came down out of heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh , for the life of the world . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore strove one with another , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood , ye have not life in yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life : and I will raise him up at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed . <EOV> <SOV> He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me , and I in him . <EOV> <SOV> As the living Father sent me , and I live because of the Father ; so he that eateth me , he also shall live because of me . <EOV> <SOV> This is the bread which came down out of heaven : not as the fathers ate , and died ; he that eateth this bread shall live for ever . <EOV> <SOV> These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum . <EOV> <SOV> Many therefore of his disciples , when the heard ' this ' , said , This is a hard saying ; who can hear it ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this , said unto them , Doth this cause you to stumble ? <EOV> <SOV> ' What ' then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he was before ? <EOV> <SOV> It is the spirit that giveth life ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit , are are life . <EOV> <SOV> But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who it was that should betray him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , For this cause have I said unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it be given unto him of the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Upon this many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said therefore unto the twelve , Would ye also go away ? <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One of God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Did not I choose you the twelve , and one of you is a devil ? <EOV> <SOV> Now he spake of Judas ' the son ' of Simon Iscariot , for he it was that should betray him , ' being ' one of the twelve . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Judaea , because the Jews sought to kill him . <EOV> <SOV> Now the feast of the Jews , the feast of tabernacles , was at hand . <EOV> <SOV> His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest . <EOV> <SOV> For no man doeth anything in secret , and himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou doest these things , manifest thyself to the world . <EOV> <SOV> For even his brethren did not believe on him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore saith unto them , My time is not yet come ; but your time is always ready . <EOV> <SOV> The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that its works are evil . <EOV> <SOV> Go ye up unto the feast : I go not up unto this feast ; because my time is not yet fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> And having said these things unto them , he abode ' still ' in Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast , then went he also up , not publicly , but as it were in secret . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ? <EOV> <SOV> And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him : some said , He is a good man ; others said , Not so , but he leadeth the multitude astray . <EOV> <SOV> Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answered them and said , My teaching is not mine , but his that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If any man willeth to do his will , he shall know of the teaching , whether it is of God , or ' whether ' I speak from myself . <EOV> <SOV> He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him . <EOV> <SOV> Did not Moses give you the law , and ' yet ' none of you doeth the law ? Why seek ye to kill me ? <EOV> <SOV> The multitude answered , Thou hast a demon : who seeketh to kill thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , I did one work , and ye all marvel because thereof . <EOV> <SOV> Moses hath given you circumcision ( not that it is of Moses , but of the fathers ) ; and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man . <EOV> <SOV> If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken ; are ye wroth with me , because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath ? <EOV> <SOV> Judge not according to appearance , but judge righteous judgment . <EOV> <SOV> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said , Is not this he whom they seek to kill ? <EOV> <SOV> And lo , he speaketh openly , and they say nothing unto him . Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when the Christ cometh , no one knoweth whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore cried in the temple , teaching and saying , Ye both know me , and know whence I am ; and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not . <EOV> <SOV> I know him ; because I am from him , and he sent me . <EOV> <SOV> They sought therefore to take him : and no man laid his hand on him , because his hour was not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> But of the multitude many believed on him ; and they said , When the Christ shall come , will he do more signs than those which this man hath done ? <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him ; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said , Yet a little while am I with you , and I go unto him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said among themselves , Whither will this man go that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ? <EOV> <SOV> What is this word that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me ; and where I am , ye can not come ? <EOV> <SOV> Now on the last day , the great ' day ' of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me and drink . <EOV> <SOV> He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , from within him shall flow rivers of living water . <EOV> <SOV> But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believed on him were to receive : for the Spirit was not yet ' given ' ; because Jesus was not yet glorified . <EOV> <SOV> ' Some ' of the multitude therefore , when they heard these words , said , This is of a truth the prophet . <EOV> <SOV> Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , What , doth the Christ come out of Galilee ? <EOV> <SOV> Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David , and from Bethlehem , the village where David was ? <EOV> <SOV> So there arose a division in the multitude because of him . <EOV> <SOV> And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him . <EOV> <SOV> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why did ye not bring him ? <EOV> <SOV> The officers answered , Never man so spake . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore answered them , Are ye also led astray ? <EOV> <SOV> Hath any of the rulers believed on him , or of the Pharisees ? <EOV> <SOV> But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed . <EOV> <SOV> Nicodemus saith unto them ( he that came to him before , being one of them ) , <EOV> <SOV> Doth our law judge a man , except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they went every man unto his own house : <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery ; and having set her in the midst , <EOV> <SOV> they say unto him , Teacher , this woman hath been taken in adultery , in the very act . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such : what then sayest thou of her ? <EOV> <SOV> And this they said , trying him , that they might have ' whereof ' to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground . <EOV> <SOV> But when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her . <EOV> <SOV> And again he stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And they , when they heard it , went out one by one , beginning from the eldest , ' even ' unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman , where she was , in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus lifted up himself , and said unto her , Woman , where are they ? did no man condemn thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And she said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said , Neither do I condemn thee : go thy way ; from henceforth sin no more . <EOV> <SOV> Again therefore Jesus spake unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness , but shall have the light of life . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said unto him , Thou bearest witness of thyself ; thy witness is not true . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto them , Even if I bear witness of myself , my witness is true ; for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye know not whence I come , or whither I go . <EOV> <SOV> Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man . <EOV> <SOV> Yea and if I judge , my judgment is true ; for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Yea and in your law it is written , that the witness of two men is true . <EOV> <SOV> I am he that beareth witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye know neither me , nor my Father : if ye knew me , ye would know my Father also . <EOV> <SOV> These words spake he in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man took him ; because his hour was not yet come . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore again unto them , I go away , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sin : whither I go , ye can not come . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said , Will he kill himself , that he saith , Whither I go , ye can not come ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world . <EOV> <SOV> I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for except ye believe that I am ' he ' , ye shall die in your sins . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , Who art thou ? Jesus said unto them , Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning . <EOV> <SOV> I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you : howbeit he that sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these speak I unto the world . <EOV> <SOV> They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am ' he ' , and ' that ' I do nothing of myself , but as the Father taught me , I speak these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he that sent me is with me ; he hath not left me alone ; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him . <EOV> <SOV> As he spake these things , many believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him , If ye abide in my word , ' then ' are ye truly my disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . <EOV> <SOV> They answered unto him , We are Abraham 's seed , and have never yet been in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin . <EOV> <SOV> And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever : the son abideth for ever . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore the Son shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed . <EOV> <SOV> I know that ye are Abraham 's seed : yet ye seek to kill me , because my word hath not free course in you . <EOV> <SOV> I speak the things which I have seen with ' my ' Father : and ye also do the things which ye heard from ' your ' father . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , Our father is Abraham . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I heard from God : this did not Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Ye do the works of your father . They said unto him , We were not born of fornication ; we have one Father , ' even ' God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I came forth and am come from God ; for neither have I come of myself , but he sent me . <EOV> <SOV> Why do ye not understand my speech ? ' Even ' because ye can not hear my word . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are of ' your ' father the devil , and the lusts of your father it is your will to do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and standeth not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father thereof . <EOV> <SOV> But because I say the truth , ye believe me not . <EOV> <SOV> Which of you convicteth me of sin ? If I say truth , why do ye not believe me ? <EOV> <SOV> He that is of God heareth the words of God : for this cause ye hear ' them ' not , because ye are not of God . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a demon ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I have not a demon ; but I honor my Father , and ye dishonor me . <EOV> <SOV> But I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my word , he shall never see death . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews said unto him , Now we know that thou hast a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my word , he shall never taste of death . <EOV> <SOV> Art thou greater than our father Abraham , who died ? and the prophets died : whom makest thou thyself ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , If I glorify myself , my glory is nothing : it is my Father that glorifieth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye have not known him : but I know him ; and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be like unto you , a liar : but I know him , and keep his word . <EOV> <SOV> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day ; and he saw it , and was glad . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was born , I am . <EOV> <SOV> They took up stones therefore to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as he passed by , he saw a man blind from his birth . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , Rabbi , who sinned , this man , or his parents , that he should be born blind ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Neither did this man sin , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him . <EOV> <SOV> We must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work . <EOV> <SOV> When I am in the world , I am the light of the world . <EOV> <SOV> When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and anointed his eyes with the clay , <EOV> <SOV> and said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam ( which is by interpretation , Sent ) . He went away therefore , and washed , and came seeing . <EOV> <SOV> The neighbors therefore , and they that saw him aforetime , that he was a beggar , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ? <EOV> <SOV> Others said , It is he : others said , No , but he is like him . He said , I am ' he ' . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , How then were thine eyes opened ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered , The man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to Siloam , and wash : so I went away and washed , and I received sight . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , Where is he ? He saith , I know not . <EOV> <SOV> They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind . <EOV> <SOV> Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes . <EOV> <SOV> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight . And he said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and I see . <EOV> <SOV> Some therefore of the Pharisees said , This man is not from God , because he keepeth not the sabbath . But others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such signs ? And there was division among them . <EOV> <SOV> They say therefore unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , in that he opened thine eyes ? And he said , He is a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and had received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight , <EOV> <SOV> and asked them , saying , Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? How then doth he now see ? <EOV> <SOV> His parents answered and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind : <EOV> <SOV> but how he now seeth , we know not ; or who opened his eyes , we know not : ask him ; he is of age ; he shall speak for himself . <EOV> <SOV> These things said his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man should confess him ' to be ' Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him . <EOV> <SOV> So they called a second time the man that was blind , and said unto him , Give glory to God : we know that this man is a sinner . <EOV> <SOV> He therefore answered , Whether he is a sinner , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore unto him , What did he to thee ? How opened he thine eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered them , I told you even now , and ye did not hear ; wherefore would ye hear it again ? would ye also become his disciples ? <EOV> <SOV> And they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are disciples of Moses . <EOV> <SOV> We know that God hath spoken unto Moses : but as for this man , we know not whence he is . <EOV> <SOV> The man answered and said unto them , Why , herein is the marvel , that ye know not whence he is , and ' yet ' he opened mine eyes . <EOV> <SOV> We know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and do his will , him he heareth . <EOV> <SOV> Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind . <EOV> <SOV> If this man were not from God , he could do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and finding him , he said , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , And who is he , Lord , that I may believe on him ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and he it is that speaketh with thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Lord , I believe . And he worshipped him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , For judgment came I into this world , that they that see not may see ; and that they that see may become blind . <EOV> <SOV> Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things , and said unto him , Are we also blind ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye would have no sin : but now ye say , We see : your sin remaineth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber . <EOV> <SOV> But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out . <EOV> <SOV> When he hath put forth all his own , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice . <EOV> <SOV> And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers . <EOV> <SOV> This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> All that came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them . <EOV> <SOV> I am the door ; by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and go out , and shall find pasture . <EOV> <SOV> The thief cometh not , but that he may steal , and kill , and destroy : I came that they may have life , and may have ' it ' abundantly . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> He that is a hireling , and not a shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , beholdeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth , and the wolf snatcheth them , and scattereth ' them ' : <EOV> <SOV> ' he fleeth ' because he is a hireling , and careth not for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> I am the good shepherd ; and I know mine own , and mine own know me , <EOV> <SOV> even as the Father knoweth me , and I know the Father ; and I lay down my life for the sheep . <EOV> <SOV> And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice : and they shall become one flock , one shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore doth the Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I may take it again . <EOV> <SOV> No one taketh it away from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment received I from my Father . <EOV> <SOV> There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words . <EOV> <SOV> And many of them said , He hath a demon , and is mad ; why hear ye him ? <EOV> <SOV> Others said , These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon . Can a demon open the eyes of the blind ? <EOV> <SOV> And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem : <EOV> <SOV> it was winter ; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon 's porch . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore came round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou hold us in suspense ? If thou art the Christ , tell us plainly . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believe not : the works that I do in my Father 's name , these bear witness of me . <EOV> <SOV> But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me : <EOV> <SOV> and I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , and no one shall snatch them out of my hand . <EOV> <SOV> My Father , who hath given ' them ' unto me , is greater than all ; and no one is able to snatch ' them ' out of the Father 's hand . <EOV> <SOV> I and the Father are one . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews took up stones again to stone him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Many good works have I showed you from the Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ? <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , For a good work we stone thee not , but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , ye are gods ? <EOV> <SOV> If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came ( and the scripture can not be broken ) , <EOV> <SOV> say ye of him , whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am ' the ' Son of God ? <EOV> <SOV> If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not . <EOV> <SOV> But if I do them , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me , and I in the Father . <EOV> <SOV> They sought again to take him : and he went forth out of their hand . <EOV> <SOV> And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing ; and there be abode . <EOV> <SOV> And many came unto him ; and they said , John indeed did no sign : but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true . <EOV> <SOV> And many believed on him there . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now a certain man was sick , Lazarus of Bethany , of the village of Mary and her sister Martha . <EOV> <SOV> And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . <EOV> <SOV> The sisters therefore sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus heard it , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified thereby . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he heard that he was sick , he abode at that time two days in the place where he was . <EOV> <SOV> Then after this he saith to the disciples , Let us go into Judaea again . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples say unto him , Rabbi , the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If a man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world . <EOV> <SOV> But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because the light is not in him . <EOV> <SOV> These things spake he : and after this he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples therefore said unto him , Lord , if he is fallen asleep , he will recover . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus had spoken of his death : but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead . <EOV> <SOV> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas therefore , who is called Didymus , said unto his fellow - disciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him . <EOV> <SOV> So when Jesus came , he found that he had been in the tomb four days already . <EOV> <SOV> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off ; <EOV> <SOV> and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary , to console them concerning their brother . <EOV> <SOV> Martha therefore , when she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary still sat in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Martha therefore said unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . <EOV> <SOV> And even now I know that , whatsoever thou shalt ask of God , God will give thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth on me , though he die , yet shall he live ; <EOV> <SOV> and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die . Believest thou this ? <EOV> <SOV> She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I have believed that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , ' even ' he that cometh into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And when she had said this , she went away , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Teacher is her , and calleth thee . <EOV> <SOV> And she , when she heard it , arose quickly , and went unto him . <EOV> <SOV> ( Now Jesus was not yet come into the village , but was still in the place where Martha met him . ) <EOV> <SOV> The Jews then who were with her in the house , and were consoling her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up quickly and went out , followed her , supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there . <EOV> <SOV> Mary therefore , when she came where Jesus was , and saw him , fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews ' also ' weeping who came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled , <EOV> <SOV> and said , Where have ye laid him ? They say unto him , Lord , come and see . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus wept . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore said , Behold how he loved him ! <EOV> <SOV> But some of them said , Could not this man , who opened the eyes of him that was blind , have caused that this man also should not die ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb . Now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time the body decayeth ; for he hath been ' dead ' four days . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou believedst , thou shouldest see the glory of God ? <EOV> <SOV> So they took away the stone . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou heardest me . <EOV> <SOV> And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it , that they may believe that thou didst send me . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had thus spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth . <EOV> <SOV> He that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with grave - clothes ; and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go . <EOV> <SOV> Many therefore of the Jews , who came to Mary and beheld that which he did , believed on him . <EOV> <SOV> But some of them went away to the Pharisees , and told them the things which Jesus had done . <EOV> <SOV> The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many signs . <EOV> <SOV> If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . <EOV> <SOV> But a certain one of them , Caiaphas , being high priest that year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all , <EOV> <SOV> nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not . <EOV> <SOV> Now this he said not of himself : but , being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation ; <EOV> <SOV> and not for the nation only , but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews , but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim ; and there he tarried with the disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Now the passover of the Jews was at hand : and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover , to purify themselves . <EOV> <SOV> They sought therefore for Jesus , and spake one with another , as they stood in the temple , What think ye ? That he will not come to the feast ? <EOV> <SOV> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment , that , if any man knew where he was , he should show it , that they might take him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , whom Jesus raised from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> So they made him a supper there : and Martha served ; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him . <EOV> <SOV> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard , very precious , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> But Judas Iscariot , one of his disciples , that should betray him , saith , <EOV> <SOV> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings , and given to the poor ? <EOV> <SOV> Now this he said , not because he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and having the bag took away what was put therein . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said , Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying . <EOV> <SOV> For the poor ye have always with you ; but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there : and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death ; <EOV> <SOV> because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> took the branches of the palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried out , Hosanna : Blessed ' is ' he that cometh in the name of the Lord , even the King of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written , <EOV> <SOV> Fear not , daughter of Zion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt . <EOV> <SOV> These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him . <EOV> <SOV> The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , bare witness . <EOV> <SOV> For this cause also the multitude went and met him , for that they heard that he had done this sign . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Behold how ye prevail nothing : lo , the world is gone after him . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast : <EOV> <SOV> these therefore came to Philip , who was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and asked him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : Andrew cometh , and Philip , and they tell Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answereth them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die , it abideth by itself alone ; but if it die , it beareth much fruit . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth his life loseth it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal . <EOV> <SOV> If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will the Father honor . <EOV> <SOV> Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour . But for this cause came I unto this hour . <EOV> <SOV> Father , glorify thy name . There came therefore a voice out of heaven , ' saying ' , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again . <EOV> <SOV> The multitude therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it had thundered : others said , An angel hath spoken to him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said , This voice hath not come for my sake , but for your sakes . <EOV> <SOV> Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out . <EOV> <SOV> And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto myself . <EOV> <SOV> But this he said , signifying by what manner of death he should die . <EOV> <SOV> The multitude therefore answered him , We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said unto them , Yet a little while is the light among you . Walk while ye have the light , that darkness overtake you not : and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth . <EOV> <SOV> While ye have the light , believe on the light , that ye may become sons of light . These things spake Jesus , and he departed and hid himself from them . <EOV> <SOV> But though he had done so many signs before them , yet they believed not on him : <EOV> <SOV> that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ? <EOV> <SOV> For this cause they could not believe , for that Isaiah said again , <EOV> <SOV> He hath blinded their eyes , and he hardened their heart ; Lest they should see with their eyes , and perceive with their heart , And should turn , And I should heal them . <EOV> <SOV> These things said Isaiah , because he saw his glory ; and he spake of him . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess ' it ' , lest they should be put out of the synagogue : <EOV> <SOV> for they loved the glory ' that is ' of men more than the glory ' that is ' of God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man hear my sayings , and keep them not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world . <EOV> <SOV> He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my sayings , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I spake , the same shall judge him in the last day . <EOV> <SOV> For I spake not from myself ; but the Father that sent me , he hath given me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak . <EOV> <SOV> And I know that his commandment is life eternal : the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father hath said unto me , so I speak . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now before the feast of the passover , Jesus knowing that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto his Father , having loved his own that were in the world , he loved them unto the end . <EOV> <SOV> And during supper , the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's ' son ' , to betray him , <EOV> <SOV> ' Jesus ' , knowing that the Father had given all the things into his hands , and that he came forth from God , and goeth unto God , <EOV> <SOV> riseth from supper , and layeth aside his garments ; and he took a towel , and girded himself . <EOV> <SOV> Then he poureth water into the basin , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded . <EOV> <SOV> So he cometh to Simon Peter . He saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt understand hereafter . <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , He that is bathed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all . <EOV> <SOV> For he knew him that should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean . <EOV> <SOV> So when he had washed their feet , and taken his garments , and sat down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye call me , Teacher , and , Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am . <EOV> <SOV> If I then , the Lord and the Teacher , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another 's feet . <EOV> <SOV> For I have given you an example , that ye also should do as I have done to you . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , a servant is not greater than his lord ; neither one that is sent greater than he that sent him . <EOV> <SOV> If ye know these things , blessed are ye if ye do them . <EOV> <SOV> I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled : He that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me . <EOV> <SOV> From henceforth I tell you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am ' he ' . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in the spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake . <EOV> <SOV> There was at the table reclining in Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore beckoneth to him , and saith unto him , Tell ' us ' who it is of whom he speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> He leaning back , as he was , on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore answereth , He it is , for whom I shall dip the sop , and give it him . So when he had dipped the sop , he taketh and giveth it to Judas , ' the son ' of Simon Iscariot . <EOV> <SOV> And after the sop , then entered Satan into him . Jesus therefore saith unto him , What thou doest , do quickly . <EOV> <SOV> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him . <EOV> <SOV> For some thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus said unto him , Buy what things we have need of for the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor . <EOV> <SOV> He then having received the sop went out straightway : and it was night . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he was gone out , Jesus saith , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him ; <EOV> <SOV> and God shall glorify him in himself , and straightway shall he glorify him . <EOV> <SOV> Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say unto you . <EOV> <SOV> A new commandment I give unto you , that ye love one another ; even as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . <EOV> <SOV> By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered , Whither I go , thou canst not follow now ; but thou shalt follow afterwards . <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith unto him , Lord , why can not I follow thee even now ? I will lay down my life for thee . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answereth , Wilt thou lay down thy life for me ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Let not your heart be troubled : believe in God , believe also in me . <EOV> <SOV> In my Father 's house are many mansions ; if it were not so , I would have told you ; for I go to prepare a place for you . <EOV> <SOV> And if I go and prepare a place for you , I come again , and will receive you unto myself ; that where I am , ' there ' ye may be also . <EOV> <SOV> And whither I go , ye know the way . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; how know we the way ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , and the truth , and the life : no one cometh unto the Father , but by me . <EOV> <SOV> If ye had known me , ye would have known my Father also : from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him . <EOV> <SOV> Philip saith unto him , Lord , show us the Father , and it sufficeth us . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and dost thou not know me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; how sayest thou , Show us the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself : but the Father abiding in me doeth his works . <EOV> <SOV> Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , he that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater ' works ' than these shall he do ; because I go unto the Father . <EOV> <SOV> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son . <EOV> <SOV> If ye shall ask anything in my name , that will I do . <EOV> <SOV> If ye love me , ye will keep my commandments . <EOV> <SOV> And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may be with you for ever , <EOV> <SOV> ' even ' the Spirit of truth : whom the world can not receive ; for it beholdeth him not , neither knoweth him : ye know him ; for he abideth with you , and shall be in you . <EOV> <SOV> I will not leave you desolate : I come unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Yet a little while , and the world beholdeth me no more ; but ye behold me : because I live , ye shall live also . <EOV> <SOV> In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Judas ( not Iscariot ) saith unto him , Lord , what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my word : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth me not keepeth not my words : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's who sent me . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you , while ' yet ' abiding with you . <EOV> <SOV> But the Comforter , ' even ' the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful . <EOV> <SOV> Ye heard how I said to you , I go away , and I come unto you . If ye loved me , ye would have rejoiced , because I go unto the Father : for the Father is greater than I. <EOV> <SOV> And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe . <EOV> <SOV> I will no more speak much with you , for the prince of the world cometh : and he hath nothing in me ; <EOV> <SOV> but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . Arise , let us go hence . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman . <EOV> <SOV> Every branch in me that beareth not fruit , he taketh it away : and every ' branch ' that beareth fruit , he cleanseth it , that it may bear more fruit . <EOV> <SOV> Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; so neither can ye , except ye abide in me . <EOV> <SOV> I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same beareth much fruit : for apart from me ye can do nothing . <EOV> <SOV> If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and they gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned . <EOV> <SOV> If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ask whatsoever ye will , and it shall be done unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; and ' so ' shall ye be my disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Even as the Father hath loved me , I also have loved you : abide ye in my love . <EOV> <SOV> If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy may be in you , and ' that ' your joy may be made full . <EOV> <SOV> This is my commandment , that ye love one another , even as I have loved you . <EOV> <SOV> Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are my friends , if ye do the things which I command you . <EOV> <SOV> No longer do I call you servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I heard from my Father , I have made known unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Ye did not choose me , but I chose you , and appointed you , that ye should go and bear fruit , and ' that ' your fruit should abide : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you . <EOV> <SOV> These things I command you , that ye may love one another . <EOV> <SOV> If the world hateth you , ye know that it hath hated me before ' it hated ' you . <EOV> <SOV> If ye were of the world , the world would love its own : but because ye are not of the world , but I chose you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you . <EOV> <SOV> Remember the word that I said unto you , A servant is not greater than his lord . If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they kept my word , they will keep yours also . <EOV> <SOV> But all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no excuse for their sin . <EOV> <SOV> He that hateth me hateth my Father also . <EOV> <SOV> If I had not done among them the works which none other did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father . <EOV> <SOV> But ' this cometh to pass ' , that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their law , They hated me without a cause . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , ' even ' the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall bear witness of me : <EOV> <SOV> and ye also bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you , that ye should not be caused to stumble . <EOV> <SOV> They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the hour cometh , that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto God . <EOV> <SOV> And these things will they do , because they have not known the Father , nor me . <EOV> <SOV> But these things have I spoken unto you , that when their hour is come , ye may remember them , how that I told you . And these things I said not unto you from the beginning , because I was with you . <EOV> <SOV> But now I go unto him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ? <EOV> <SOV> But because I have spoken these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart . <EOV> <SOV> Nevertheless I tell you the truth : It is expedient for you that I go away ; for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I go , I will send him unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And he , when he is come , will convict the world in respect of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment : <EOV> <SOV> of sin , because they believe not on me ; <EOV> <SOV> of righteousness , because I go to the Father , and ye behold me no more ; <EOV> <SOV> of judgment , because the prince of this world hath been judged . <EOV> <SOV> I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now . <EOV> <SOV> Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he shall guide you into all the truth : for he shall not speak from himself ; but what things soever he shall hear , ' these ' shall he speak : and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come . <EOV> <SOV> He shall glorify me : for he shall take of mine , and shall declare ' it ' unto you . <EOV> <SOV> All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he taketh of mine , and shall declare ' it ' unto you . <EOV> <SOV> A little while , and ye behold me no more ; and again a little while , and ye shall see me . <EOV> <SOV> ' Some ' of his disciples therefore said one to another , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye behold me not ; and again a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ? <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? We know not what he saith . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him , and he said unto them , Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this , that I said , A little while , and ye behold me not , and again a little while , and ye shall see me ? <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto you , that ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy . <EOV> <SOV> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but when she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for the joy that a man is born into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And ye therefore now have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no one taketh away from you . <EOV> <SOV> And in that day ye shall ask me no question . Verily , verily , I say unto you , if ye shall ask anything of the Father , he will give it you in my name . <EOV> <SOV> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be made full . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings : the hour cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings , but shall tell you plainly of the Father . <EOV> <SOV> In that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you ; <EOV> <SOV> for the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came forth from the Father . <EOV> <SOV> I came out from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go unto the Father . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no dark saying . <EOV> <SOV> Now know we that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and ' yet ' I am not alone , because the Father is with me . <EOV> <SOV> These things have I spoken unto you , that in me ye may have peace . In the world ye have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> These things spake Jesus ; and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that the son may glorify thee : <EOV> <SOV> even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh , that to all whom thou hast given him , he should give eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> And this is life eternal , that they should know thee the only true God , and him whom thou didst send , ' even ' Jesus Christ . <EOV> <SOV> I glorified thee on the earth , having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do . <EOV> <SOV> And now , Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was . <EOV> <SOV> I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them to me ; and they have kept thy word . <EOV> <SOV> Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee : <EOV> <SOV> for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them ; and they received ' them ' , and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee , and they believed that thou didst send me . <EOV> <SOV> I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for those whom thou hast given me ; for they are thine : <EOV> <SOV> and all things that are mine are thine , and thine are mine : and I am glorified in them . <EOV> <SOV> And I am no more in the world , and these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep them in thy name which thou hast given me , that they may be one , even as we ' are ' . <EOV> <SOV> While I was with them , I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me : and I guarded them , and not one of them perished , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> But now I come to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves . <EOV> <SOV> I have given them thy word ; and the world hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil ' one ' . <EOV> <SOV> They are not of the world even as I am not of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Sanctify them in the truth : thy word is truth . <EOV> <SOV> As thou didst send me into the world , even so sent I them into the world . <EOV> <SOV> And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth . <EOV> <SOV> Neither for these only do I pray , but for them also that believe on me through their word ; <EOV> <SOV> that they may all be one ; even as thou , Father , ' art ' in me , and I in thee , that they also may be in us : that the world may believe that thou didst send me . <EOV> <SOV> And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them ; that they may be one , even as we ' are ' one ; <EOV> <SOV> I in them , and thou in me , that they may be perfected into one ; that the world may know that thou didst send me , and lovedst them , even as thou lovedst me . <EOV> <SOV> Father , I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am , that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world . <EOV> <SOV> O righteous Father , the world knew thee not , but I knew thee ; and these knew that thou didst send me ; <EOV> <SOV> and I made known unto them thy name , and will make it known ; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them , and I in them . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Kidron , where was a garden , into which he entered , himself and his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Now Judas also , who betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus oft - times resorted thither with his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Judas then , having received the band ' of soldiers ' , and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore , knowing all the things that were coming upon him , went forth , and saith unto them , Whom seek ye ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am ' he ' . And Judas also , who betrayed him , was standing with them . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore he said unto them , I am ' he ' , they went backward , and fell to the ground . <EOV> <SOV> Again therefore he asked them , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , I told you that I am ' he ' ; if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way : <EOV> <SOV> that the word might be fulfilled which he spake , Of those whom thou hast given me I lost not one . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it , and struck the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . Now the servant 's name was Malchus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said unto Peter , Put up the sword into the sheath : the cup which the Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ? <EOV> <SOV> So the band and the chief captain , and the officers of the Jews , seized Jesus and bound him , <EOV> <SOV> and led him to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , who was high priest that year . <EOV> <SOV> Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and ' so did ' another disciple . Now that disciple was known unto the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ; <EOV> <SOV> but Peter was standing at the door without . So the other disciple , who was known unto the high priest , went out and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter . <EOV> <SOV> The maid therefore that kept the door saith unto Peter , Art thou also ' one ' of this man 's disciples ? He saith , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> Now the servants and the officers were standing ' there ' , having made a fire of coals ; for it was cold ; and they were warming themselves : and Peter also was with them , standing and warming himself . <EOV> <SOV> The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his teaching . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , I have spoken openly to the world ; I ever taught in synagogues , and in the temple , where all the Jews come together ; and in secret spake I nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Why askest thou me ? Ask them that have heard ' me ' , what I spake unto them : behold , these know the things which I said . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ? <EOV> <SOV> Annas therefore sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest . <EOV> <SOV> Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself . They said therefore unto him , Art thou also ' one ' of his disciples ? He denied , and said , I am not . <EOV> <SOV> One of the servants of the high priest , being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter therefore denied again : and straightway the cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium : and it was early ; and they themselves entered not into the Praetorium , that they might not be defiled , but might eat the passover . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore went out unto them , and saith , What accusation bring ye against this man ? <EOV> <SOV> They answered and said unto him , If this man were not an evildoer , we should not have delivered him up unto thee . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore said unto them , Take him yourselves , and judge him according to your law . The Jews said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death : <EOV> <SOV> that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying by what manner of death he should die . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , Sayest thou this of thyself , or did others tell it thee concerning me ? <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a king . To this end have I been born , and to this end am I come into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find no crime in him . <EOV> <SOV> But ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> They cried out therefore again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber . ) <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and scourged him . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and arrayed him in a purple garment ; <EOV> <SOV> and they came unto him , and said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they struck him with their hands . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate went out again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him out to you , that ye may know that I find no crime in him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment . And ' Pilate ' saith unto them , Behold , the man ! <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify ' him ' , crucify ' him ' ! Pilate saith unto them , Take him yourselves , and crucify him : for I find no crime in him . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by that law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate therefore heard this saying , he was the more afraid ; <EOV> <SOV> and he entered into the Praetorium again , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate therefore saith unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee , and have power to crucify thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered him , Thou wouldest have no power against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin . <EOV> <SOV> Upon this Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou release this man , thou art not Caesar 's friend : every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment - seat at a place called The Pavement , but in Hebrew , Gabbatha . <EOV> <SOV> Now it was the Preparation of the passover : it was about the sixth hour . And he saith unto the Jews , Behold , your King ! <EOV> <SOV> They therefore cried out , Away with ' him ' , away with ' him ' , crucify him ! Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar . <EOV> <SOV> Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> They took Jesus therefore : and he went out , bearing the cross for himself , unto the place called The place of a skull , which is called in Hebrew , Golgotha : <EOV> <SOV> where they crucified him , and with him two others , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . And there was written , JESUS OF NAZARETH , THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> This title therefore read many of the Jews , for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , ' and ' in Latin , ' and ' in Greek . <EOV> <SOV> The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate answered , What I have written I have written . <EOV> <SOV> The soldiers therefore , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also the coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout . <EOV> <SOV> They said therefore one to another , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my garments among them , And upon my vesture did they cast lots . <EOV> <SOV> These things therefore the soldiers did . But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the ' wife ' of Clopas , and Mary Magdalene . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son ! <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to the disciple , Behold , thy mother ! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own ' home ' . <EOV> <SOV> After this Jesus , knowing that all things are now finished , that the scripture might be accomplished , saith , I thirst . <EOV> <SOV> There was set there a vessel full of vinegar : so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop , and brought it to his mouth . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up his spirit . <EOV> <SOV> The Jews therefore , because it was the Preparation , that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath ( for the day of that sabbath was a high ' day ' ) , asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken , and ' that ' they might be taken away . <EOV> <SOV> The soldiers therefore came , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other that was crucified with him : <EOV> <SOV> but when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs : <EOV> <SOV> howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and straightway there came out blood and water . <EOV> <SOV> And he that hath seen hath borne witness , and his witness is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye also may believe . <EOV> <SOV> For these things came to pass , that the scripture might be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken . <EOV> <SOV> And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave ' him ' leave . He came therefore , and took away his body . <EOV> <SOV> And there came also Nicodemus , he who at the first came to him by night , bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about a hundred pounds . <EOV> <SOV> So they took the body of Jesus , and bound it in linen cloths with the spices , as the custom of the Jews is to bury . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid . <EOV> <SOV> There then because of the Jews ' Preparation ( for the tomb was nigh at hand ) they laid Jesus . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now on the first ' day ' of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , while it was yet dark , unto the tomb , and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> She runneth therefore , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb , and we know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> Peter therefore went forth , and the other disciple , and they went toward the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And they ran both together : and the other disciple outran Peter , and came first to the tomb ; <EOV> <SOV> and stooping and looking in , he seeth the linen cloths lying ; yet entered he not in . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore also cometh , following him , and entered into the tomb ; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying , <EOV> <SOV> and the napkin , that was upon his head , not lying with the linen cloths , but rolled up in a place by itself . <EOV> <SOV> Then entered in therefore the other disciple also , who came first to the tomb , and he saw , and believed . <EOV> <SOV> For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> So the disciples went away again unto their own home . <EOV> <SOV> But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping : so , as she wept , she stooped and looked into the tomb ; <EOV> <SOV> and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting , one at the head , and one at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain . <EOV> <SOV> And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him . <EOV> <SOV> When she had thus said , she turned herself back , and beholdeth Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou hast borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turneth herself , and saith unto him in Hebrew , Rabboni ; which is to say , Teacher . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father : but go unto my brethren , and say to them , I ascend unto my Father and your Father , and my God and your God . <EOV> <SOV> Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples , I have seen the Lord ; and ' that ' he had said these things unto her . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore it was evening , on that day , the first ' day ' of the week , and when the doors were shut where the disciples were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace ' be ' unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , he showed unto them his hands and his side . The disciples therefore were glad , when they saw the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore said to them again , Peace ' be ' unto you : as the Father hath sent me , even so send I you . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Spirit : <EOV> <SOV> whose soever sins ye forgive , they are forgiven unto them ; whose soever ' sins ' ye retain , they are retained . <EOV> <SOV> But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came . <EOV> <SOV> The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the Lord . But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my hand into his side , I will not believe . <EOV> <SOV> And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them . Jesus cometh , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace ' be ' unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and see my hands ; and reach ' hither ' thy hand , and put it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing . <EOV> <SOV> Thomas answered and said unto him , My Lord and my God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , Because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed ' are ' they that have not seen , and ' yet ' have believed . <EOV> <SOV> Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples , which are not written in this book : <EOV> <SOV> but these are written , that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye may have life in his name . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; and he manifested ' himself ' on this wise . <EOV> <SOV> There was together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the ' sons ' of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . They say unto him , We also come with thee . They went forth , and entered into the boat ; and that night they took nothing . <EOV> <SOV> But when day was now breaking , Jesus stood on the beach : yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus therefore saith unto them , Children , have ye aught to eat ? They answered him , No . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the boat , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes . <EOV> <SOV> That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his coat about him ( for he was naked ) , and cast himself into the sea . <EOV> <SOV> But the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cubits off ) , dragging the net ' full ' of fishes . <EOV> <SOV> So when they got out upon the land , they see a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , Bring of the fish which ye have now taken . <EOV> <SOV> Simon Peter therefore went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fishes , a hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , the net was not rent . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , Come ' and ' break your fast . And none of the disciples durst inquire of him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus cometh , and taketh the bread , and giveth them , and the fish likewise . <EOV> <SOV> This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples , after that he was risen from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> So when they had broken their fast , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , ' son ' of John , lovest thou me more than these ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my lambs . <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him again a second time , Simon , ' son ' of John , lovest thou me ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Tend my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto him the third time , Simon , ' son ' of John , lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , Lovest thou me ? And he said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I love thee . Jesus saith unto him , Feed my sheep . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not . <EOV> <SOV> Now this he spake , signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God . And when he had spoken this , he saith unto him , Follow me . <EOV> <SOV> Peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following ; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper , and said , Lord , who is he that betrayeth thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus , Lord , and what shall this man do ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , If I will that he tarry till I come , what ' is that ' to thee ? Follow thou me . <EOV> <SOV> This saying therefore went forth among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet Jesus said not unto him , that he should not die ; but , If I will that he tarry till I come , what ' is that ' to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his witness is true . <EOV> <SOV> And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written . <EOV> <EOC>
