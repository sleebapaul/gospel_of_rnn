<SOC> <SOV> Seeing that many did take in hand to set in order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us , <EOV> <SOV> as they did deliver to us , who from the beginning became eye - witnesses , and officers of the Word , -- <EOV> <SOV> it seemed good also to me , having followed from the first after all things exactly , to write to thee in order , most noble Theophilus , <EOV> <SOV> that thou mayest know the certainty of the things wherein thou wast instructed . <EOV> <SOV> There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judea , a certain priest , by name Zacharias , of the course of Abijah , and his wife of the daughters of Aaron , and her name Elisabeth ; <EOV> <SOV> and they were both righteous before God , going on in all the commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless , <EOV> <SOV> and they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and both were advanced in their days . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his acting as priest , in the order of his course before God , <EOV> <SOV> according to the custom of the priesthood , his lot was to make perfume , having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord , <EOV> <SOV> and all the multitude of the people were praying without , at the hour of the perfume . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume , <EOV> <SOV> and Zacharias , having seen , was troubled , and fear fell on him ; <EOV> <SOV> and the messenger said unto him , ' Fear not , Zacharias , for thy supplication was heard , and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear a son to thee , and thou shalt call his name John , <EOV> <SOV> and there shall be joy to thee , and gladness , and many at his birth shall joy , <EOV> <SOV> for he shall be great before the Lord , and wine and strong drink he may not drink , and of the Holy Spirit he shall be full , even from his mother 's womb ; <EOV> <SOV> and many of the sons of Israel he shall turn to the Lord their God , <EOV> <SOV> and he shall go before Him , in the spirit and power of Elijah , to turn hearts of fathers unto children , and disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones , to make ready for the Lord , a people prepared . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias said unto the messenger , ' Whereby shall I know this ? for I am aged , and my wife is advanced in her days ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And the messenger answering said to him , ' I am Gabriel , who have been standing near before God , and I was sent to speak unto thee , and to proclaim these good news to thee , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , thou shalt be silent , and not able to speak , till the day that these things shall come to pass , because thou didst not believe my words , that shall be fulfilled in their season . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the people were waiting for Zacharias , and wondering at his tarrying in the sanctuary , <EOV> <SOV> and having come out , he was not able to speak to them , and they perceived that a vision he had seen in the sanctuary , and he was beckoning to them , and did remain dumb . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he went away to his house , <EOV> <SOV> and after those days , his wife Elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying -- <EOV> <SOV> ' Thus hath the Lord done to me , in days in which He looked upon ' me ' , to take away my reproach among men . ' <EOV> <SOV> And in the sixth month was the messenger Gabriel sent by God , to a city of Galilee , the name of which ' is ' Nazareth , <EOV> <SOV> to a virgin , betrothed to a man , whose name ' is ' Joseph , of the house of David , and the name of the virgin ' is ' Mary . <EOV> <SOV> And the messenger having come in unto her , said , ' Hail , favoured one , the Lord ' is ' with thee ; blessed ' art ' thou among women ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and she , having seen , was troubled at his word , and was reasoning of what kind this salutation may be . <EOV> <SOV> And the messenger said to her , ' Fear not , Mary , for thou hast found favour with God ; <EOV> <SOV> and lo , thou shalt conceive in the womb , and shalt bring forth a son , and call his name Jesus ; <EOV> <SOV> he shall be great , and Son of the Highest he shall be called , and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father , <EOV> <SOV> and he shall reign over the house of Jacob to the ages ; and of his reign there shall be no end . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said unto the messenger , ' How shall this be , seeing a husband I do not know ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And the messenger answering said to her , ' The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee , therefore also the holy - begotten thing shall be called Son of God ; <EOV> <SOV> and lo , Elisabeth , thy kinswoman , she also hath conceived a son in her old age , and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren ; <EOV> <SOV> because nothing shall be impossible with God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , ' Lo , the maid - servant of the Lord ; let it be to me according to thy saying , ' and the messenger went away from her . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary having arisen in those days , went to the hill - country , with haste , to a city of Judea , <EOV> <SOV> and entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe did leap in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit , <EOV> <SOV> and spake out with a loud voice , and said , ' Blessed ' art ' thou among women , and blessed ' is ' the fruit of thy womb ; <EOV> <SOV> and whence ' is ' this to me , that the mother of my Lord might come unto me ? <EOV> <SOV> for , lo , when the voice of thy salutation came to my ears , leap in gladness did the babe in my womb ; <EOV> <SOV> and happy ' is ' she who did believe , for there shall be a completion to the things spoken to her from the Lord . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Mary said , ' My soul doth magnify the Lord , <EOV> <SOV> And my spirit was glad on God my Saviour , <EOV> <SOV> Because He looked on the lowliness of His maid - servant , For , lo , henceforth call me happy shall all the generations , <EOV> <SOV> For He who is mighty did to me great things , And holy ' is ' His name , <EOV> <SOV> And His kindness ' is ' to generations of generations , To those fearing Him , <EOV> <SOV> He did powerfully with His arm , He scattered abroad the proud in the thought of their heart , <EOV> <SOV> He brought down the mighty from thrones , And He exalted the lowly , <EOV> <SOV> The hungry He did fill with good , And the rich He sent away empty , <EOV> <SOV> He received again Israel His servant , To remember kindness , <EOV> <SOV> As He spake unto our fathers , To Abraham and to his seed -- to the age . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Mary remained with her about three months , and turned back to her house . <EOV> <SOV> And to Elisabeth was the time fulfilled for her bringing forth , and she bare a son , <EOV> <SOV> and the neighbours and her kindred heard that the Lord was making His kindness great with her , and they were rejoicing with her . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , on the eighth day , they came to circumcise the child , and they were calling him by the name of his father , Zacharias , <EOV> <SOV> and his mother answering said , ' No , but he shall be called John . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto her -- ' There is none among thy kindred who is called by this name , ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were making signs to his father , what he would wish him to be called , <EOV> <SOV> and having asked for a tablet , he wrote , saying , ' John is his name ; ' and they did all wonder ; <EOV> <SOV> and his mouth was opened presently , and his tongue , and he was speaking , praising God . <EOV> <SOV> And fear came upon all those dwelling around them , and in all the hill - country of Judea were all these sayings spoken of , <EOV> <SOV> and all who heard did lay them up in their hearts , saying , ' What then shall this child be ? ' and the hand of the Lord was with him . <EOV> <SOV> And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit , and did prophesy , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Blessed ' is ' the Lord , the God of Israel , Because He did look upon , And wrought redemption for His people , <EOV> <SOV> And did raise an horn of salvation to us , In the house of David His servant , <EOV> <SOV> As He spake by the mouth of His holy prophets , Which have been from the age ; <EOV> <SOV> Salvation from our enemies , And out of the hand of all hating us , <EOV> <SOV> To do kindness with our fathers , And to be mindful of His holy covenant , <EOV> <SOV> An oath that He sware to Abraham our father , <EOV> <SOV> To give to us , without fear , Out of the hand of our enemies having been delivered , <EOV> <SOV> To serve Him , in holiness and righteousness Before Him , all the days of our life . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , child , Prophet of the Highest Shalt thou be called ; For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord , To prepare His ways . <EOV> <SOV> To give knowledge of salvation to His people In remission of their sins , <EOV> <SOV> Through the tender mercies of our God , In which the rising from on high did look upon us , <EOV> <SOV> To give light to those sitting in darkness and death - shade , To guide our feet to a way of peace . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the child grew , and was strengthened in spirit , and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus , that all the world be enrolled -- <EOV> <SOV> this enrollment first came to pass when Cyrenius was governor of Syria -- <EOV> <SOV> and all were going to be enrolled , each to his proper city , <EOV> <SOV> and Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , to Judea , to the city of David , that is called Bethlehem , because of his being of the house and family of David , <EOV> <SOV> to enroll himself with Mary his betrothed wife , being with child . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in their being there , the days were fulfilled for her bringing forth , <EOV> <SOV> and she brought forth her son -- the first - born , and wrapped him up , and laid him down in the manger , because there was not for them a place in the guest - chamber . <EOV> <SOV> And there were shepherds in the same region , lodging in the field , and keeping the night - watches over their flock , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a messenger of the Lord stood over them , and the glory of the Lord shone around them , and they feared a great fear . <EOV> <SOV> And the messenger said to them , ' Fear not , for lo , I bring you good news of great joy , that shall be to all the people -- <EOV> <SOV> because there was born to you to - day a Saviour -- who is Christ the Lord -- in the city of David , <EOV> <SOV> and this ' is ' to you the sign : Ye shall find a babe wrapped up , lying in the manger . ' <EOV> <SOV> And suddenly there came with the messenger a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Glory in the highest to God , and upon earth peace , among men -- good will . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when the messengers were gone away from them to the heavens , that the men , the shepherds , said unto one another , ' We may go over indeed unto Bethlehem , and see this thing that hath come to pass , that the Lord did make known to us . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they came , having hasted , and found both Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in the manger , <EOV> <SOV> and having seen , they made known abroad concerning the saying spoken to them concerning the child . <EOV> <SOV> And all who heard , did wonder concerning the things spoken by the shepherds unto them ; <EOV> <SOV> and Mary was preserving all these things , pondering in her heart ; <EOV> <SOV> and the shepherds turned back , glorifying and praising God , for all those things they heard and saw , as it was spoken unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise the child , then was his name called Jesus , having been so called by the messenger before his being conceived in the womb . <EOV> <SOV> And when the days of their purification were fulfilled , according to the law of Moses , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present to the Lord , <EOV> <SOV> as it hath been written in the Law of the Lord , -- ' Every male opening a womb shall be called holy to the Lord , ' <EOV> <SOV> and to give a sacrifice , according to that said in the Law of the Lord , ' A pair of turtle - doves , or two young pigeons . ' <EOV> <SOV> And lo , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name ' is ' Simeon , and this man is righteous and devout , looking for the comforting of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was upon him , <EOV> <SOV> and it hath been divinely told him by the Holy Spirit -- not to see death before he may see the Christ of the Lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he came in the Spirit to the temple , and in the parents bringing in the child Jesus , for their doing according to the custom of the law regarding him , <EOV> <SOV> then he took him in his arms , and blessed God , and he said , <EOV> <SOV> ' Now Thou dost send away Thy servant , Lord , according to Thy word , in peace , <EOV> <SOV> because mine eyes did see Thy salvation , <EOV> <SOV> which Thou didst prepare before the face of all the peoples , <EOV> <SOV> a light to the uncovering of nations , and the glory of Thy people Israel . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph and his mother were wondering at the things spoken concerning him , <EOV> <SOV> and Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , ' Lo , this ' one ' is set for the falling and rising again of many in Israel , and for a sign spoken against -- <EOV> <SOV> ( and also thine own soul shall a sword pass through ) -- that the reasonings of many hearts may be revealed . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there was Anna , a prophetess , daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Asher , she was much advanced in days , having lived with an husband seven years from her virginity , <EOV> <SOV> and she ' is ' a widow of about eighty - four years , who did depart not from the temple , with fasts and supplications serving , night and day , <EOV> <SOV> and she , at that hour , having come in , was confessing , likewise , to the Lord , and was speaking concerning him , to all those looking for redemption in Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And when they finished all things , according to the Law of the Lord , they turned back to Galilee , to their city Nazareth ; <EOV> <SOV> and the child grew and was strengthened in spirit , being filled with wisdom , and the grace of God was upon him . <EOV> <SOV> And his parents were going yearly to Jerusalem , at the feast of the passover , <EOV> <SOV> and when he became twelve years old , they having gone up to Jerusalem , according to the custom of the feast , <EOV> <SOV> and having finished the days , in their returning the child Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem , and Joseph and his mother did not know , <EOV> <SOV> and , having supposed him to be in the company , they went a day 's journey , and were seeking him among the kindred and among the acquaintances , <EOV> <SOV> and not having found him , they turned back to Jerusalem seeking him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , after three days , they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the teachers , both hearing them and questioning them , <EOV> <SOV> and all those hearing him were astonished at his understanding and answers . <EOV> <SOV> And , having seen him , they were amazed , and his mother said unto him , ' Child , why didst thou thus to us ? lo , thy father and I , sorrowing , were seeking thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' Why ' is it ' that ye were seeking me ? did ye not know that in the things of my Father it behoveth me to be ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they did not understand the saying that he spake to them , <EOV> <SOV> and he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and he was subject to them , and his mother was keeping all these sayings in her heart , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus was advancing in wisdom , and in stature , and in favour with God and men . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius Caesar -- Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea , and Herod tetrarch of Galilee , and Philip his brother , tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene -- <EOV> <SOV> Annas and Caiaphas being chief priests -- there came a word of God unto John the son of Zacharias , in the wilderness , <EOV> <SOV> and he came to all the region round the Jordan , proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins , <EOV> <SOV> as it hath been written in the scroll of the words of Isaiah the prophet , saying , ' A voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , straight make ye His paths ; <EOV> <SOV> every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be made low , and the crooked shall become straightness , and the rough become smooth ways ; <EOV> <SOV> and all flesh shall see the salvation of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to the multitudes coming forth to be baptised by him , ' Brood of vipers ! who did prompt you to flee from the coming wrath ? <EOV> <SOV> make , therefore , fruits worthy of the reformation , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have a father -- Abraham ; for I say to you , that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham ; <EOV> <SOV> and already also the axe unto the root of the trees is laid , every tree , therefore , not making good fruit is cut down , and to fire it is cast . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes were questioning him , saying , ' What , then , shall we do ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he answering saith to them , ' He having two coats -- let him impart to him having none , and he having victuals -- in like manner let him do . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there came also tax - gatherers to be baptised , and they said unto him , ' Teacher , what shall we do ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto them , ' Exact no more than that directed you . ' <EOV> <SOV> And questioning him also were those warring , saying , ' And we , what shall we do ? ' and he said unto them , ' Do violence to no one , nor accuse falsely , and be content with your wages . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the people are looking forward , and all are reasoning in their hearts concerning John , whether or not he may be the Christ ; <EOV> <SOV> John answered , saying to all , ' I indeed with water do baptise you , but he cometh who is mightier than I , of whom I am not worthy to loose the latchet of his sandals -- he shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire ; <EOV> <SOV> whose winnowing shovel ' is ' in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor , and will gather the wheat to his storehouse , and the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable . ' <EOV> <SOV> And , therefore , indeed with many other things , exhorting , he was proclaiming good news to the people , <EOV> <SOV> and Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him concerning Herodias the wife of Philip his brother , and concerning all the evils that Herod did , <EOV> <SOV> added also this to all , that he shut up John in the prison . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in all the people being baptised , Jesus also being baptised , and praying , the heaven was opened , <EOV> <SOV> and the Holy Spirit came down in a bodily appearance , as if a dove , upon him , and a voice came out of heaven , saying , ' Thou art My Son -- the Beloved , in thee I did delight . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus himself was beginning to be about thirty years of age , being , as was supposed , son of Joseph , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Eli , the ' son ' of Matthat , the ' son ' of Levi , the ' son ' of Melchi , the ' son ' of Janna , the ' son ' of Joseph , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Mattathias , the ' son ' of Amos , the ' son ' of Naum , the ' son ' of Esli , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Naggai , the ' son ' of Maath , the ' son ' of Mattathias , the ' son ' of Semei , the ' son ' of Joseph , the ' son ' of Juda , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Joanna , the ' son ' of Rhesa , the ' son ' of Zerubbabel , the ' son ' of Shealtiel , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Neri , the ' son ' of Melchi , the ' son ' of Addi , the ' son ' of Cosam , the ' son ' of Elmodam , the ' son ' of Er , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Jose , the ' son ' of Eliezer , the ' son ' of Jorim , the ' son ' of Matthat , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Levi , the ' son ' of Simeon , the ' son ' of Juda , the ' son ' of Joseph , the ' son ' of Jonan , the ' son ' of Eliakim , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Melea , the ' son ' of Mainan , the ' son ' of Mattatha , the ' son ' of Nathan , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of David , the ' son ' of Jesse , the ' son ' of Obed , the ' son ' of Booz , the ' son ' of Salmon , the ' son ' of Nahshon , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Amminadab , the ' son ' of Aram , the ' son ' of Esrom , the ' son ' of Pharez , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Judah , the ' son ' of Jacob , the ' son ' of Isaac , the ' son ' of Abraham , the ' son ' of Terah , the ' son ' of Nahor , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Serug , the ' son ' of Reu , the ' son ' of Peleg , the ' son ' of Eber , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Salah , the ' son ' of Cainan , the ' son ' of Arphaxad , the ' son ' of Shem , the ' son ' of Noah , the ' son ' of Lamech , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Methuselah , the ' son ' of Enoch , the ' son ' of Jared , the ' son ' of Mahalaleel , <EOV> <SOV> the ' son ' of Cainan , the ' son ' of Enos , the ' son ' of Seth , the ' son ' of Adam , the ' son ' of God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , turned back from the Jordan , and was brought in the Spirit to the wilderness , <EOV> <SOV> forty days being tempted by the Devil , and he did not eat anything in those days , and they having been ended , he afterward hungered , <EOV> <SOV> and the Devil said to him , ' If Son thou art of God , speak to this stone that it may become bread . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered him , saying , ' It hath been written , that , not on bread only shall man live , but on every saying of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the Devil having brought him up to an high mountain , shewed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time , <EOV> <SOV> and the Devil said to him , ' To thee I will give all this authority , and their glory , because to me it hath been delivered , and to whomsoever I will , I do give it ; <EOV> <SOV> thou , then , if thou mayest bow before me -- all shall be thine . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering him said , ' Get thee behind me , Adversary , for it hath been written , Thou shalt bow before the Lord thy God , and Him only thou shalt serve . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pinnacle of the temple , and said to him , ' If the Son thou art of God , cast thyself down hence , <EOV> <SOV> for it hath been written -- To His messengers He will give charge concerning thee , to guard over thee , <EOV> <SOV> and -- On hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou mayest dash against a stone thy foot . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him -- ' It hath been said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having ended all temptation , the Devil departed from him till a convenient season . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus turned back in the power of the Spirit to Galilee , and a fame went forth through all the region round about concerning him , <EOV> <SOV> and he was teaching in their synagogues , being glorified by all . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Nazareth , where he hath been brought up , and he went in , according to his custom , on the sabbath - day , to the synagogue , and stood up to read ; <EOV> <SOV> and there was given over to him a roll of Isaiah the prophet , and having unfolded the roll , he found the place where it hath been written : <EOV> <SOV> ' The Spirit of the Lord ' is ' upon me , Because He did anoint me ; To proclaim good news to the poor , Sent me to heal the broken of heart , To proclaim to captives deliverance , And to blind receiving of sight , To send away the bruised with deliverance , <EOV> <SOV> To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having folded the roll , having given ' it ' back to the officer , he sat down , and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing on him . <EOV> <SOV> And he began to say unto them -- ' To - day hath this writing been fulfilled in your ears ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and all were bearing testimony to him , and were wondering at the gracious words that are coming forth out of his mouth , and they said , ' Is not this the son of Joseph ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' Certainly ye will say to me this simile , Physician , heal thyself ; as great things as we heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' Verily I say to you -- No prophet is accepted in his own country ; <EOV> <SOV> and of a truth I say to you , Many widows were in the days of Elijah , in Israel , when the heaven was shut for three years and six months , when great famine came on all the land , <EOV> <SOV> and unto none of them was Elijah sent , but -- to Sarepta of Sidon , unto a woman , a widow ; <EOV> <SOV> and many lepers were in the time of Elisha the prophet , in Israel , and none of them was cleansed , but -- Naaman the Syrian . ' <EOV> <SOV> And all in the synagogue were filled with wrath , hearing these things , <EOV> <SOV> and having risen , they put him forth without the city , and brought him unto the brow of the hill on which their city had been built -- to cast him down headlong , <EOV> <SOV> and he , having gone through the midst of them , went away . <EOV> <SOV> And he came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and was teaching them on the sabbaths , <EOV> <SOV> and they were astonished at his teaching , because his word was with authority . <EOV> <SOV> And in the synagogue was a man , having a spirit of an unclean demon , and he cried out with a great voice , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Away , what -- to us and to thee , Jesus , O Nazarene ? thou didst come to destroy us ; I have known thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus did rebuke him , saying , ' Be silenced , and come forth out of him ; ' and the demon having cast him into the midst , came forth from him , having hurt him nought ; <EOV> <SOV> and amazement came upon all , and they were speaking together , with one another , saying , ' What ' is ' this word , that with authority and power he doth command the unclean spirits , and they come forth ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and there was going forth a fame concerning him to every place of the region round about . <EOV> <SOV> And having risen out of the synagogue , he entered into the house of Simon , and the mother - in - law of Simon was pressed with a great fever , and they did ask him about her , <EOV> <SOV> and having stood over her , he rebuked the fever , and it left her , and presently , having risen , she was ministering to them . <EOV> <SOV> And at the setting of the sun , all , as many as had any ailing with manifold sicknesses , brought them unto him , and he on each one of them ' his ' hands having put , did heal them . <EOV> <SOV> And demons also were coming forth from many , crying out and saying -- ' Thou art the Christ , the Son of God ; ' and rebuking , he did not suffer them to speak , because they knew him to be the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> And day having come , having gone forth , he went on to a desert place , and the multitudes were seeking him , and they came unto him , and were staying him -- not to go on from them , <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto them -- ' Also to the other cities it behoveth me to proclaim good news of the reign of God , because for this I have been sent ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , in the multitude pressing on him to hear the word of God , that he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret , <EOV> <SOV> and he saw two boats standing beside the lake , and the fishers , having gone away from them , were washing the nets , <EOV> <SOV> and having entered into one of the boats , that was Simon 's , he asked him to put back a little from the land , and having sat down , was teaching the multitudes out of the boat . <EOV> <SOV> And when he left off speaking , he said unto Simon , ' Put back to the deep , and let down your nets for a draught ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Simon answering said to him , ' Master , through the whole night , having laboured , we have taken nothing , but at thy saying I will let down the net . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having done this , they enclosed a great multitude of fishes , and their net was breaking , <EOV> <SOV> and they beckoned to the partners , who ' are ' in the other boat , having come , to help them ; and they came , and filled both the boats , so that they were sinking . <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter having seen , fell down at the knees of Jesus , saying , ' Depart from me , because I am a sinful man , O lord ; ' <EOV> <SOV> for astonishment seized him , and all those with him , at the draught of the fishes that they took , <EOV> <SOV> and in like manner also James and John , sons of Zebedee , who were partners with Simon ; and Jesus said unto Simon , ' Fear not , henceforth thou shalt be catching men ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they , having brought the boats upon the land , having left all , did follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his being in one of the cities , that lo , a man full of leprosy , and having seen Jesus , having fallen on ' his ' face , he besought him , saying , ' Sir , if thou mayest will , thou art able to cleanse me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having stretched forth ' his ' hand , he touched him , having said , ' I will ; be thou cleansed ; ' and immediately the leprosy went away from him . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged him to tell no one , ' But , having gone away , shew thyself to the priest , and bring near for thy cleansing according as Moses directed , for a testimony to them ; ' <EOV> <SOV> but the more was the report going abroad concerning him , and great multitudes were coming together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities , <EOV> <SOV> and he was withdrawing himself in the desert places and was praying . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , on one of the days , that he was teaching , and there were sitting by Pharisees and teachers of the Law , who were come out of every village of Galilee , and Judea , and Jerusalem , and the power of the Lord was -- to heal them . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , men bearing upon a couch a man , who hath been struck with palsy , and they were seeking to bring him in , and to place before him , <EOV> <SOV> and not having found by what way they may bring him in because of the multitude , having gone up on the house - top , through the tiles they let him down , with the little couch , into the midst before Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> and he having seen their faith , said to him , ' Man , thy sins have been forgiven thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , ' Who is this that doth speak evil words ? who is able to forgive sins , except God only ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having known their reasonings , answering , said unto them , ' What reason ye in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> which is easier -- to say , Thy sins have been forgiven thee ? or to say , Arise , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority upon the earth to forgive sins -- ( he said to the one struck with palsy ) -- I say to thee , Arise , and having taken up thy little couch , be going on to thy house . ' <EOV> <SOV> And presently having risen before them , having taken up ' that ' on which he was lying , he went away to his house , glorifying God , <EOV> <SOV> and astonishment took all , and they were glorifying God , and were filled with fear , saying -- ' We saw strange things to - day . ' <EOV> <SOV> And after these things he went forth , and beheld a tax - gatherer , by name Levi , sitting at the tax - office , and said to him , ' Be following me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he , having left all , having arisen , did follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And Levi made a great entertainment to him in his house , and there was a great multitude of tax - gatherers and others who were with them reclining ( at meat ) , <EOV> <SOV> and the scribes and the Pharisees among them were murmuring at his disciples , saying , ' Wherefore with tax - gatherers and sinners do ye eat and drink ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto them , ' They who are well have no need of a physician , but they that are ill : <EOV> <SOV> I came not to call righteous men , but sinners , to reformation . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , ' Wherefore do the disciples of John fast often , and make supplications -- in like manner also those of the Pharisees -- but thine do eat and drink ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' Are ye able to make the sons of the bride - chamber -- in the bridegroom being with them -- to fast ? <EOV> <SOV> but days will come , and , when the bridegroom may be taken away from them , then they shall fast in those days . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake also a simile unto them -- ' No one a patch of new clothing doth put on old clothing , and if otherwise , the new also doth make a rent , and with the old the patch doth not agree , that ' is ' from the new . <EOV> <SOV> ' And no one doth put new wine into old skins , and if otherwise , the new wine will burst the skins , and itself will be poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; <EOV> <SOV> but new wine into new skins is to be put , and both are preserved together ; <EOV> <SOV> and no one having drunk old ' wine ' , doth immediately wish new , for he saith , The old is better . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , on the second - first sabbath , as he is going through the corn fields , that his disciples were plucking the ears , and were eating , rubbing with the hands , <EOV> <SOV> and certain of the Pharisees said to them , ' Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbaths ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto them , ' Did ye not read even this that David did , when he hungered , himself and those who are with him , <EOV> <SOV> how he went into the house of God , and the loaves of the presentation did take , and did eat , and gave also to those with him , which it is not lawful to eat , except only to the priests ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , -- ' The Son of Man is lord also of the sabbath . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass also , on another sabbath , that he goeth into the synagogue , and teacheth , and there was there a man , and his right hand was withered , <EOV> <SOV> and the scribes and the Pharisees were watching him , if on the sabbath he will heal , that they might find an accusation against him . <EOV> <SOV> And he himself had known their reasonings , and said to the man having the withered hand , ' Rise , and stand in the midst ; ' and he having risen , stood . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto them , ' I will question you something : Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good , or to do evil ? life to save or to kill ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And having looked round on them all , he said to the man , ' Stretch forth thy hand ; ' and he did so , and his hand was restored whole as the other ; <EOV> <SOV> and they were filled with madness , and were speaking with one another what they might do to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , he went forth to the mountain to pray , and was passing the night in the prayer of God , <EOV> <SOV> and when it became day , he called near his disciples , and having chosen from them twelve , whom also he named apostles , <EOV> <SOV> ( Simon , whom also he named Peter , and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew , <EOV> <SOV> Matthew and Thomas , James of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes , <EOV> <SOV> Judas of James , and Judas Iscariot , who also became betrayer ; ) <EOV> <SOV> and having come down with them , he stood upon a level spot , and a crowd of his disciples , and a great multitude of the people from all Judea , and Jerusalem , and the maritime Tyre and Sidon , who came to hear him , and to be healed of their sicknesses , <EOV> <SOV> and those harassed by unclean spirits , and they were healed , <EOV> <SOV> and all the multitude were seeking to touch him , because power from him was going forth , and he was healing all . <EOV> <SOV> And he , having lifted up his eyes to his disciples , said : ' Happy the poor -- because yours is the reign of God . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy those hungering now -- because ye shall be filled . ' Happy those weeping now -- because ye shall laugh . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy are ye when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you , and shall reproach , and shall cast forth your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake -- <EOV> <SOV> rejoice in that day , and leap , for lo , your reward ' is ' great in the heaven , for according to these things were their fathers doing to the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> ' But wo to you -- the rich , because ye have got your comfort . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you who have been filled -- because ye shall hunger . ' Wo to you who are laughing now -- because ye shall mourn and weep . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you when all men shall speak well of you -- for according to these things were their fathers doing to false prophets . <EOV> <SOV> ' But I say to you who are hearing , Love your enemies , do good to those hating you , <EOV> <SOV> bless those cursing you , and pray for those accusing you falsely ; <EOV> <SOV> and to him smiting thee upon the cheek , give also the other , and from him taking away from thee the mantle , also the coat thou mayest not keep back . <EOV> <SOV> ' And to every one who is asking of thee , be giving ; and from him who is taking away thy goods , be not asking again ; <EOV> <SOV> and as ye wish that men may do to you , do ye also to them in like manner ; <EOV> <SOV> and -- if ye love those loving you , what grace have ye ? for also the sinful love those loving them ; <EOV> <SOV> and if ye do good to those doing good to you , what grace have ye ? for also the sinful do the same ; <EOV> <SOV> and if ye lend ' to those ' of whom ye hope to receive back , what grace have ye ? for also the sinful lend to sinners -- that they may receive again as much . <EOV> <SOV> ' But love your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again , and your reward will be great , and ye shall be sons of the Highest , because He is kind unto the ungracious and evil ; <EOV> <SOV> be ye therefore merciful , as also your Father is merciful . <EOV> <SOV> ' And judge not , and ye may not be judged ; condemn not , and ye may not be condemned ; release , and ye shall be released . <EOV> <SOV> ' Give , and it shall be given to you ; good measure , pressed , and shaken , and running over , they shall give into your bosom ; for with that measure with which ye measure , it shall be measured to you again . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a simile to them , ' Is blind able to lead blind ? shall they not both fall into a pit ? <EOV> <SOV> A disciple is not above his teacher , but every one perfected shall be as his teacher . <EOV> <SOV> ' And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , and the beam that ' is ' in thine own eye dost not consider ? <EOV> <SOV> or how art thou able to say to thy brother , Brother , suffer , I may take out the mote that ' is ' in thine eye -- thyself the beam in thine own eye not beholding ? Hypocrite , take first the beam out of thine own eye , and then thou shalt see clearly to take out the mote that ' is ' in thy brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> ' For there is not a good tree making bad fruit , nor a bad tree making good fruit ; <EOV> <SOV> for each tree from its own fruit is known , for not from thorns do they gather figs , nor from a bramble do they crop a grape . <EOV> <SOV> ' The good man out of the good treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which ' is ' good ; and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart doth bring forth that which ' is ' evil ; for out of the abounding of the heart doth his mouth speak . <EOV> <SOV> ' And why do ye call me , Lord , Lord , and do not what I say ? <EOV> <SOV> Every one who is coming unto me , and is hearing my words , and is doing them , I will shew you to whom he is like ; <EOV> <SOV> he is like to a man building a house , who did dig , and deepen , and laid a foundation upon the rock , and a flood having come , the stream broke forth on that house , and was not able to shake it , for it had been founded upon the rock . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he who heard and did not , is like to a man having builded a house upon the earth , without a foundation , against which the stream brake forth , and immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house became great . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when he completed all his sayings in the ears of the people , he went into Capernaum ; <EOV> <SOV> and a certain centurion 's servant being ill , was about to die , who was much valued by him , <EOV> <SOV> and having heard about Jesus , he sent unto him elders of the Jews , beseeching him , that having come he might thoroughly save his servant . <EOV> <SOV> And they , having come near unto Jesus , were calling upon him earnestly , saying -- ' He is worthy to whom thou shalt do this , <EOV> <SOV> for he doth love our nation , and the synagogue he did build to us . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus was going on with them , and now when he is not far distant from the house the centurion sent unto him friends , saying to him , ' Sir , be not troubled , for I am not worthy that under my roof thou mayest enter ; <EOV> <SOV> wherefore not even myself thought I worthy to come unto thee , but say in a word , and my lad shall be healed ; <EOV> <SOV> for I also am a man placed under authority , having under myself soldiers , and I say to this ' one ' , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Be coming , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doth ' it ' . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having heard these things Jesus wondered at him , and having turned to the multitude following him , he said , ' I say to you , not even in Israel so much faith did I find ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and those sent , having turned back to the house , found the ailing servant in health . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , on the morrow , he was going on to a city called Nain , and there were going with him many of his disciples , and a great multitude , <EOV> <SOV> and as he came nigh to the gate of the city , then , lo , one dead was being carried forth , an only son of his mother , and she a widow , and a great multitude of the city was with her . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord having seen her , was moved with compassion towards her , and said to her , ' Be not weeping ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having come near , he touched the bier , and those bearing ' it ' stood still , and he said , ' Young man , to thee I say , Arise ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and the dead sat up , and began to speak , and he gave him to his mother ; <EOV> <SOV> and fear took hold of all , and they were glorifying God , saying -- ' A great prophet hath risen among us , ' and -- ' God did look upon His people . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the account of this went forth in all Judea about him , and in all the region around . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John told him about all these things , <EOV> <SOV> and John having called near a certain two of his disciples , sent unto Jesus , saying , ' Art thou he who is coming , or for another do we look ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And having come near to him , the men said , ' John the Baptist sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he who is coming , or for another do we look ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And in that hour he cured many from sicknesses , and plagues , and evil spirits , and to many blind he granted sight . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' Having gone on , report to John what ye saw and heard , that blind men do see again , lame do walk , lepers are cleansed , deaf do hear , dead are raised , poor have good news proclaimed ; <EOV> <SOV> and happy is he whoever may not be stumbled in me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the messengers of John having gone away , he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John : ' What have ye gone forth to the wilderness to look on ? a reed by the wind shaken ? <EOV> <SOV> but what have ye gone forth to see ? a man in soft garments clothed ? lo , they in splendid apparellings , and living in luxury , are in the houses of kings ! <EOV> <SOV> ' But what have ye gone forth to see ? a prophet ? Yes , I say to you , and much more than a prophet : <EOV> <SOV> this is he concerning whom it hath been written , Lo , I send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , a greater prophet , among those born of women , than John the Baptist there is not ; but the least in the reign of God is greater than he . ' <EOV> <SOV> And all the people having heard , and the tax - gatherers , declared God righteous , having been baptized with the baptism of John , <EOV> <SOV> but the Pharisees , and the lawyers , the counsel of God did put away for themselves , not having been baptized by him . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , ' To what , then , shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ? <EOV> <SOV> they are like to children , to those sitting in a market - place , and calling one to another , and saying , We piped to you , and ye did not dance , we mourned to you , and ye did not weep ! <EOV> <SOV> ' For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine , and ye say , He hath a demon ; <EOV> <SOV> the Son of Man came eating and drinking , and ye say , Lo , a man , a glutton , and a wine drinker , a friend of tax - gatherers and sinners ; <EOV> <SOV> and the wisdom was justified from all her children . ' <EOV> <SOV> And a certain one of the Pharisees was asking him that he might eat with him , and having gone into the house of the Pharisee he reclined ( at meat ) , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a woman in the city , who was a sinner , having known that he reclineth ( at meat ) in the house of the Pharisee , having provided an alabaster box of ointment , <EOV> <SOV> and having stood behind , beside his feet , weeping , she began to wet his feet with the tears , and with the hairs of her head she was wiping , and was kissing his feet , and was anointing with the ointment . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisee who did call him , having seen , spake within himself , saying , ' This one , if he were a prophet , would have known who and of what kind ' is ' the woman who doth touch him , that she is a sinner . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said unto him , ' Simon , I have something to say to thee ; ' and he saith , ' Teacher , say on . ' <EOV> <SOV> ' Two debtors were to a certain creditor ; the one was owing five hundred denaries , and the other fifty ; <EOV> <SOV> and they not having ' wherewith ' to give back , he forgave both ; which then of them , say thou , will love him more ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Simon answering said , ' I suppose that to whom he forgave the more ; ' and he said to him , ' Rightly thou didst judge . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having turned unto the woman , he said to Simon , ' Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thy house ; water for my feet thou didst not give , but this woman with tears did wet my feet , and with the hairs of her head did wipe ; <EOV> <SOV> a kiss to me thou didst not give , but this woman , from what ' time ' I came in , did not cease kissing my feet ; <EOV> <SOV> with oil my head thou didst not anoint , but this woman with ointment did anoint my feet ; <EOV> <SOV> therefore I say to thee , her many sins have been forgiven , because she did love much ; but to whom little is forgiven , little he doth love . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , ' Thy sins have been forgiven ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and those reclining with him ( at meat ) began to say within themselves , ' Who is this , who also doth forgive sins ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto the woman , ' Thy faith have saved thee , be going on to peace . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass thereafter , that he was going through every city and village , preaching and proclaiming good news of the reign of God , and the twelve ' are ' with him , <EOV> <SOV> and certain women , who were healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary who is called Magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone forth , <EOV> <SOV> and Joanna wife of Chuza , steward of Herod , and Susanna , and many others , who were ministering to him from their substance . <EOV> <SOV> And a great multitude having gathered , and those who from city and city were coming unto him , he spake by a simile : <EOV> <SOV> ' The sower went forth to sow his seed , and in his sowing some indeed fell beside the way , and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the heaven did devour it . <EOV> <SOV> ' And other fell upon the rock , and having sprung up , it did wither , through not having moisture . <EOV> <SOV> ' And other fell amidst the thorns , and the thorns having sprung up with it , did choke it . <EOV> <SOV> ' And other fell upon the good ground , and having sprung up , it made fruit an hundred fold . ' These things saying , he was calling , ' He having ears to hear -- let him hear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples were questioning him , saying , ' What may this simile be ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' To you it hath been given to know the secrets of the reign of God , and to the rest in similes ; that seeing they may not see , and hearing they may not understand . <EOV> <SOV> ' And this is the simile : The seed is the word of God , <EOV> <SOV> and those beside the way are those hearing , then cometh the Devil , and taketh up the word from their heart , lest having believed , they may be saved . <EOV> <SOV> ' And those upon the rock : They who , when they may hear , with joy do receive the word , and these have no root , who for a time believe , and in time of temptation fall away . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that which fell to the thorns : These are they who have heard , and going forth , through anxieties , and riches , and pleasures of life , are choked , and bear not to completion . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that in the good ground : These are they , who in an upright and good heart , having heard the word , do retain ' it ' , and bear fruit in continuance . <EOV> <SOV> ' And no one having lighted a lamp doth cover it with a vessel , or under a couch doth put ' it ' ; but upon a lamp - stand he doth put ' it ' , that those coming in may see the light , <EOV> <SOV> for nothing is secret , that shall not become manifest , nor hid , that shall not be known , and become manifest . <EOV> <SOV> ' See , therefore , how ye hear , for whoever may have , there shall be given to him , and whoever may not have , also what he seemeth to have , shall be taken from him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there came unto him his mother and brethren , and they were not able to get to him because of the multitude , <EOV> <SOV> and it was told him , saying , ' Thy mother and thy brethren do stand without , wishing to see thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said unto them , ' My mother and my brethren ! they are those who the word of God are hearing , and doing . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , on one of the days , that he himself went into a boat with his disciples , and he said unto them , ' We may go over to the other side of the lake ; ' and they set forth , <EOV> <SOV> and as they are sailing he fell deeply asleep , and there came down a storm of wind to the lake , and they were filling , and were in peril . <EOV> <SOV> And having come near , they awoke him , saying , ' Master , master , we perish ; ' and he , having arisen , rebuked the wind and the raging of the water , and they ceased , and there came a calm , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Where is your faith ? ' and they being afraid did wonder , saying unto one another , ' Who , then , is this , that even the winds he doth command , and the water , and they obey him ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And they sailed down to the region of the Gadarenes , that is over - against Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and he having gone forth upon the land , there met him a certain man , out of the city , who had demons for a long time , and with a garment was not clothed , and in a house was not abiding , but in the tombs , <EOV> <SOV> and having seen Jesus , and having cried out , he fell before him , and with a loud voice , said , ' What -- to me and to thee , Jesus , Son of God Most High ? I beseech thee , mayest thou not afflict me ! ' <EOV> <SOV> For he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man , for many times it had caught him , and he was being bound with chains and fetters -- guarded , and breaking asunder the bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus questioned him , saying , ' What is thy name ? ' and he said , ' Legion , ' ( because many demons were entered into him , ) <EOV> <SOV> and he was calling on him , that he may not command them to go away to the abyss , <EOV> <SOV> and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain , and they were calling on him , that he might suffer them to enter into these , and he suffered them , <EOV> <SOV> and the demons having gone forth from the man , did enter into the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep to the lake , and were choked . <EOV> <SOV> And those feeding ' them ' , having seen what was come to pass , fled , and having gone , told ' it ' to the city , and to the fields ; <EOV> <SOV> and they came forth to see what was come to pass , and they came unto Jesus , and found the man sitting , out of whom the demons had gone forth , clothed , and right - minded , at the feet of Jesus , and they were afraid ; <EOV> <SOV> and those also having seen ' it ' , told them how the demoniac was saved . <EOV> <SOV> And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them , because with great fear they were pressed , and he having entered into the boat , did turn back . <EOV> <SOV> And the man from whom the demons had gone forth was beseeching of him to be with him , and Jesus sent him away , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Turn back to thy house , and tell how great things God did to thee ; ' and he went away through all the city proclaiming how great things Jesus did to him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in the turning back of Jesus , the multitude received him , for they were all looking for him , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , there came a man , whose name ' is ' Jairus , and he was a chief of the synagogue , and having fallen at the feet of Jesus , was calling on him to come to his house ; <EOV> <SOV> because he had an only daughter about twelve years ' old ' , and she was dying . And in his going away , the multitudes were thronging him , <EOV> <SOV> and a woman , having an issue of blood for twelve years , who , having spent on physicians all her living , was not able to be healed by any , <EOV> <SOV> having come near behind , touched the fringe of his garment , and presently the issue of her blood stood . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' Who ' is ' it that touched me ? ' and all denying , Peter and those with him said , ' Master , the multitudes press thee , and throng ' thee ' , and thou dost say , Who ' is ' it that touched me ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' Some one did touch me , for I knew power having gone forth from me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the woman , having seen that she was not hid , trembling , came , and having fallen before him , for what cause she touched him declared to him before all the people , and how she was healed presently ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said to her , ' Take courage , daughter , thy faith hath saved thee , be going on to peace . ' <EOV> <SOV> While he is yet speaking , there doth come a certain one from the chief of the synagogue 's ' house ' , saying to him -- ' Thy daughter hath died , harass not the Teacher ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having heard , answered him , saying , ' Be not afraid , only believe , and she shall be saved . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having come to the house , he suffered no one to go in , except Peter , and James , and John , and the father of the child , and the mother ; <EOV> <SOV> and they were all weeping , and beating themselves for her , and he said , ' Weep not , she did not die , but doth sleep ; <EOV> <SOV> and they were deriding him , knowing that she did die ; <EOV> <SOV> and he having put all forth without , and having taken hold of her hand , called , saying , ' Child , arise ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and her spirit came back , and she arose presently , and he directed that there be given to her to eat ; <EOV> <SOV> and her parents were amazed , but he charged them to say to no one what was come to pass . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having called together his twelve disciples , he gave them power and authority over all the demons , and to cure sicknesses , <EOV> <SOV> and he sent them to proclaim the reign of God , and to heal the ailing . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' Take nothing for the way , neither staff , nor scrip , nor bread , nor money ; neither have two coats each ; <EOV> <SOV> and into whatever house ye may enter , there remain , and thence depart ; <EOV> <SOV> and as many as may not receive you , going forth from that city , even the dust from your feet shake off , for a testimony against them . ' <EOV> <SOV> And going forth they were going through the several villages , proclaiming good news , and healing everywhere . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things being done by him , and was perplexed , because it was said by certain , that John hath been raised out of the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> and by certain , that Elijah did appear , and by others , that a prophet , one of the ancients , was risen ; <EOV> <SOV> and Herod said , ' John I did behead , but who is this concerning whom I hear such things ? ' and he was seeking to see him . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles having turned back , declared to him how great things they did , and having taken them , he withdrew by himself to a desert place of a city called Bethsaida , <EOV> <SOV> and the multitudes having known did follow him , and having received them , he was speaking to them concerning the reign of God , and those having need of service he cured . <EOV> <SOV> And the day began to decline , and the twelve having come near , said to him , ' Let away the multitude , that having gone to the villages and the fields round about , they may lodge and may find provision , because here we are in a desert place . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' Give ye them to eat ; ' and they said , ' We have no more than five loaves , and two fishes : except , having gone , we may buy for all this people victuals ; ' <EOV> <SOV> for they were about five thousand men . And he said unto his disciples , ' Cause them to recline in companies , in each fifty ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they did so , and made all to recline ; <EOV> <SOV> and having taken the five loaves , and the two fishes , having looked up to the heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and was giving to the disciples to set before the multitude ; <EOV> <SOV> and they did eat , and were all filled , and there was taken up what was over to them of broken pieces , twelve baskets . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he is praying alone , the disciples were with him , and he questioned them , saying , ' Who do the multitudes say me to be ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And they answering said , ' John the Baptist ; and others , Elijah ; and others , that a prophet , one of the ancients , was risen ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' And ye -- who do ye say me to be ? ' and Peter answering said , ' The Christ of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having charged them , he commanded ' them ' to say this to no one , <EOV> <SOV> saying -- ' It behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many things , and to be rejected by the elders , and chief priests , and scribes , and to be killed , and the third day to be raised . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto all , ' If any one doth will to come after me , let him disown himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me ; <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may will to save his life , shall lose it , and whoever may lose his life for my sake , he shall save it ; <EOV> <SOV> for what is a man profited , having gained the whole world , and having lost or having forfeited himself ? <EOV> <SOV> ' For whoever may be ashamed of me , and of my words , of this one shall the Son of Man be ashamed , when he may come in his glory , and the Father 's , and the holy messengers ' ; <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , truly , there are certain of those here standing , who shall not taste of death till they may see the reign of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , after these words , as it were eight days , that having taken Peter , and John , and James , he went up to the mountain to pray , <EOV> <SOV> and it came to pass , in his praying , the appearance of his face became altered , and his garment white -- sparkling . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , two men were speaking together with him , who were Moses and Elijah , <EOV> <SOV> who having appeared in glory , spake of his outgoing that he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> but Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep , and having waked , they saw his glory , and the two men standing with him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in their parting from him , Peter said unto Jesus , ' Master , it is good to us to be here ; and we may make three booths , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah , ' not knowing what he saith : <EOV> <SOV> and as he was speaking these things , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them , and they feared in their entering into the cloud , <EOV> <SOV> and a voice came out of the cloud saying , ' This is My Son -- the Beloved ; hear ye him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone ; and they were silent , and declared to no one in those days anything of what they have seen . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass on the next day , they having come down from the mount , there met him a great multitude , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a man from the multitude cried out , saying , ' Teacher , I beseech thee , look upon my son , because he is my only begotten ; <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a spirit doth take him , and suddenly he doth cry out , and it teareth him , with foaming , and it hardly departeth from him , bruising him , <EOV> <SOV> and I besought thy disciples that they might cast it out , and they were not able . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , ' O generation , unstedfast and perverse , till when shall I be with you , and suffer you ? bring near hither thy son ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and as he is yet coming near , the demon rent him , and tore ' him ' sore , and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the youth , and gave him back to his father . <EOV> <SOV> And they were all amazed at the greatness of God , and while all are wondering at all things that Jesus did , he said unto his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> ' Lay ye to your ears these words , for the Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were not knowing this saying , and it was veiled from them , that they might not perceive it , and they were afraid to ask him about this saying . <EOV> <SOV> And there entered a reasoning among them , this , Who may be greater of them ? <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having seen the reasoning of their heart , having taken hold of a child , set him beside himself , <EOV> <SOV> and said to them , ' Whoever may receive this child in my name , doth receive me , and whoever may receive me , doth receive Him who sent me , for he who is least among you all -- he shall be great . ' <EOV> <SOV> And John answering said , ' Master , we saw a certain one in thy name casting forth the demons , and we forbade him , because he doth not follow with us ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said unto him , ' Forbid not , for he who is not against us , is for us . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in the completing of the days of his being taken up , that he fixed his face to go on to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> and he sent messengers before his face , and having gone on , they went into a village of Samaritans , to make ready for him , <EOV> <SOV> and they did not receive him , because his face was going on to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples James and John having seen , said , ' Sir , wilt thou ' that ' we may command fire to come down from the heaven , and to consume them , as also Elijah did ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and having turned , he rebuked them , and said , ' Ye have not known of what spirit ye are ; <EOV> <SOV> for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save ; ' and they went on to another village . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as they are going on in the way , a certain one said unto him , ' I will follow thee wherever thou mayest go , sir ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to him , ' The foxes have holes , and the fowls of the heaven places of rest , but the Son of Man hath not where he may recline the head . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto another , ' Be following me ; ' and he said , ' Sir , permit me , having gone away , first to bury my father ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to him , ' Suffer the dead to bury their own dead , and thou , having gone away , publish the reign of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And another also said , ' I will follow thee , sir , but first permit me to take leave of those in my house ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said unto him , ' No one having put his hand on a plough , and looking back , is fit for the reign of God . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And after these things , the Lord did appoint also other seventy , and sent them by twos before his face , to every city and place whither he himself was about to come , <EOV> <SOV> then said he unto them , ' The harvest indeed ' is ' abundant , but the workmen few ; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest , that He may put forth workmen to His harvest . <EOV> <SOV> ' Go away ; lo , I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves ; <EOV> <SOV> carry no bag , no scrip , nor sandals ; and salute no one on the way ; <EOV> <SOV> and into whatever house ye do enter , first say , Peace to this house ; <EOV> <SOV> and if indeed there may be there the son of peace , rest on it shall your peace ; and if not so , upon you it shall turn back . <EOV> <SOV> ' And in that house remain , eating and drinking the things they have , for worthy ' is ' the workman of his hire ; go not from house to house , <EOV> <SOV> and into whatever city ye enter , and they may receive you , eat the things set before you , <EOV> <SOV> and heal the ailing in it , and say to them , The reign of God hath come nigh to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' And into whatever city ye do enter , and they may not receive you , having gone forth to its broad places , say , <EOV> <SOV> And the dust that hath cleaved to us , from your city , we do wipe off against you , but this know ye , that the reign of God hath come nigh to you ; <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to thee , Chorazin ; wo to thee , Bethsaida ; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you , long ago , sitting in sackcloth and ashes , they had reformed ; <EOV> <SOV> but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you . <EOV> <SOV> ' And thou , Capernaum , which unto the heaven wast exalted , unto hades thou shalt be brought down . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is hearing you , doth hear me ; and he who is putting you away , doth put me away ; and he who is putting me away , doth put away Him who sent me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the seventy turned back with joy , saying , ' Sir , and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' I was beholding the Adversary , as lightning from the heaven having fallen ; <EOV> <SOV> lo , I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions , and on all the power of the enemy , and nothing by any means shall hurt you ; <EOV> <SOV> but , in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subjected to you , but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens . ' <EOV> <SOV> In that hour was Jesus glad in the Spirit , and said , ' I do confess to thee , Father , Lord of the heaven and of the earth , that Thou didst hide these things from wise men and understanding , and didst reveal them to babes ; yes , Father , because so it became good pleasure before Thee . <EOV> <SOV> ' All things were delivered up to me by my Father , and no one doth know who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to whom the Son may wish to reveal ' Him ' . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having turned unto the disciples , he said , by themselves , ' Happy the eyes that are perceiving what ye perceive ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , that many prophets and kings did wish to see what ye perceive , and did not see , and to hear what ye hear , and did not hear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And lo , a certain lawyer stood up , trying him , and saying , ' Teacher , what having done , life age - during shall I inherit ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , ' In the law what hath been written ? how dost thou read ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said , ' Thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart , and out of all thy soul , and out of all thy strength , and out of all thy understanding , and thy neighbour as thyself . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , ' Rightly thou didst answer ; this do , and thou shalt live . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , willing to declare himself righteous , said unto Jesus , ' And who is my neighbour ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having taken up ' the word ' , said , ' A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among robbers , and having stripped him and inflicted blows , they went away , leaving ' him ' half dead . <EOV> <SOV> ' And by a coincidence a certain priest was going down in that way , and having seen him , he passed over on the opposite side ; <EOV> <SOV> and in like manner also , a Levite , having been about the place , having come and seen , passed over on the opposite side . <EOV> <SOV> ' But a certain Samaritan , journeying , came along him , and having seen him , he was moved with compassion , <EOV> <SOV> and having come near , he bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine , and having lifted him up on his own beast , he brought him to an inn , and was careful of him ; <EOV> <SOV> and on the morrow , going forth , taking out two denaries , he gave to the innkeeper , and said to him , Be careful of him , and whatever thou mayest spend more , I , in my coming again , will give back to thee . <EOV> <SOV> ' Who , then , of these three , seemeth to thee to have become neighbour of him who fell among the robbers ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' He who did the kindness with him , ' then Jesus said to him , ' Be going on , and thou be doing in like manner . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in their going on , that he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman , by name Martha , did receive him into her house , <EOV> <SOV> and she had also a sister , called Mary , who also , having seated herself beside the feet of Jesus , was hearing the word , <EOV> <SOV> and Martha was distracted about much serving , and having stood by him , she said , ' Sir , dost thou not care that my sister left me alone to serve ? say then to her , that she may partake along with me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to her , ' Martha , Martha , thou art anxious and disquieted about many things , <EOV> <SOV> but of one thing there is need , and Mary the good part did choose , that shall not be taken away from her . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his being in a certain place praying , as he ceased , a certain one of his disciples said unto him , ' Sir , teach us to pray , as also John taught his disciples . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' When ye may pray , say ye : Our Father who art in the heavens ; hallowed be Thy name : Thy reign come ; Thy will come to pass , as in heaven also on earth ; <EOV> <SOV> our appointed bread be giving us daily ; <EOV> <SOV> and forgive us our sins , for also we ourselves forgive every one indebted to us ; and mayest Thou not bring us into temptation ; but do Thou deliver us from the evil . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' Who of you shall have a friend , and shall go on unto him at midnight , and may say to him , Friend , lend me three loaves , <EOV> <SOV> seeing a friend of mine came out of the way unto me , and I have not what I shall set before him , <EOV> <SOV> and he from within answering may say , Do not give me trouble , already the door hath been shut , and my children with me are in the bed , I am not able , having risen , to give to thee . <EOV> <SOV> ' I say to you , even if he will not give to him , having risen , because of his being his friend , yet because of his importunity , having risen , he will give him as many as he doth need ; <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you ; <EOV> <SOV> for every one who is asking doth receive ; and he who is seeking doth find ; and to him who is knocking it shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> ' And of which of you -- the father -- if the son shall ask a loaf , a stone will he present to him ? and if a fish , will he instead of a fish , a serpent present to him ? <EOV> <SOV> and if he may ask an egg , will he present to him a scorpion ? <EOV> <SOV> If , then , ye , being evil , have known good gifts to be giving to your children , how much more shall the Father who is from heaven give the Holy Spirit to those asking Him ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was casting forth a demon , and it was dumb , and it came to pass , the demon having gone forth , the dumb man spake , and the multitudes wondered , <EOV> <SOV> and certain of them said , ' By Beelzeboul , ruler of the demons , he doth cast forth the demons ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and others , tempting , a sign out of heaven from him were asking . <EOV> <SOV> And he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , ' Every kingdom having been divided against itself is desolated ; and house against house doth fall ; <EOV> <SOV> and if also the Adversary against himself was divided , how shall his kingdom be made to stand ? for ye say , by Beelzeboul is my casting forth the demons . <EOV> <SOV> ' But if I by Beelzeboul cast forth the demons -- your sons , by whom do they cast forth ? because of this your judges they shall be ; <EOV> <SOV> but if by the finger of God I cast forth the demons , then come unawares upon you did the reign of God . <EOV> <SOV> ' When the strong man armed may keep his hall , in peace are his goods ; <EOV> <SOV> but when the stronger than he , having come upon ' him ' , may overcome him , his whole - armour he doth take away in which he had trusted , and his spoils he distributeth ; <EOV> <SOV> he who is not with me is against me , and he who is not gathering with me doth scatter . <EOV> <SOV> ' When the unclean spirit may go forth from the man it walketh through waterless places seeking rest , and not finding , it saith , I will turn back to my house whence I came forth ; <EOV> <SOV> and having come , it findeth ' it ' swept and adorned ; <EOV> <SOV> then doth it go , and take to it seven other spirits more evil than itself , and having entered , they dwell there , and the last of that man becometh worst than the first . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his saying these things , a certain woman having lifted up the voice out of the multitude , said to him , ' Happy the womb that carried thee , and the paps that thou didst suck ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' Yea , rather , happy those hearing the word of God , and keeping ' it ' ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes crowding together upon him , he began to say , ' This generation is evil , a sign it doth seek after , and a sign shall not be given to it , except the sign of Jonah the prophet , <EOV> <SOV> for as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites , so also shall the Son of Man be to this generation . <EOV> <SOV> ' A queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and shall condemn them , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and lo , greater than Solomon here ! <EOV> <SOV> ' Men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it , because they reformed at the proclamation of Jonah ; and lo , greater than Jonah here ! <EOV> <SOV> ' And no one having lighted a lamp , doth put ' it ' in a secret place , nor under the measure , but on the lamp - stand , that those coming in may behold the light . <EOV> <SOV> ' The lamp of the body is the eye , when then thine eye may be simple , thy whole body also is lightened ; and when it may be evil , thy body also is darkened ; <EOV> <SOV> take heed , then , lest the light that ' is ' in thee be darkness ; <EOV> <SOV> if then thy whole body is lightened , not having any part darkened , the whole shall be lightened , as when the lamp by the brightness may give thee light . ' <EOV> <SOV> And in ' his ' speaking , a certain Pharisee was asking him that he might dine with him , and having gone in , he reclined ( at meat ) , <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisee having seen , did wonder that he did not first baptize himself before the dinner . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said unto him , ' Now do ye , the Pharisees , the outside of the cup and of the plate make clean , but your inward part is full of rapine and wickedness ; <EOV> <SOV> unthinking ! did not He who made the outside also the inside make ? <EOV> <SOV> But what ye have give ye ' as ' alms , and , lo , all things are clean to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' But wo to you , the Pharisees , because ye tithe the mint , and the rue , and every herb , and ye pass by the judgment , and the love of God ; these things it behoveth to do , and those not to be neglecting . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , the Pharisees , because ye love the first seats in the synagogues , and the salutations in the market - places . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , because ye are as the unseen tombs , and the men walking above have not known . ' <EOV> <SOV> And one of the lawyers answering , saith to him , ' Teacher , these things saying , us also thou dost insult ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' And to you , the lawyers , wo ! because ye burden men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves with one of your fingers do not touch the burdens . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them . <EOV> <SOV> Then do ye testify , and are well pleased with the works of your fathers , because they indeed killed them , and ye do build their tombs ; <EOV> <SOV> because of this also the wisdom of God said : I will send to them prophets , and apostles , and some of them they shall kill and persecute , <EOV> <SOV> that the blood of all the prophets , that is being poured forth from the foundation of the world , may be required from this generation ; <EOV> <SOV> from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , who perished between the altar and the house ; yes , I say to you , It shall be required from this generation . <EOV> <SOV> ' Wo to you , the lawyers , because ye took away the key of the knowledge ; yourselves ye did not enter ; and those coming in , ye did hinder . ' <EOV> <SOV> And in his speaking these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began fearfully to urge and to press him to speak about many things , <EOV> <SOV> laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At which time the myriads of the multitude having been gathered together , so as to tread upon one another , he began to say unto his disciples , first , ' Take heed to yourselves of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy ; <EOV> <SOV> and there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known ; <EOV> <SOV> because whatever in the darkness ye said , in the light shall be heard : and what to the ear ye spake in the inner - chambers , shall be proclaimed upon the house - tops . <EOV> <SOV> ' And I say to you , my friends , be not afraid of those killing the body , and after these things are not having anything over to do ; <EOV> <SOV> but I will show to you , whom ye may fear ; Fear him who , after the killing , is having authority to cast to the gehenna ; yes , I say to you , Fear ye Him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Are not five sparrows sold for two assars ? and one of them is not forgotten before God , <EOV> <SOV> but even the hairs of your head have been all numbered ; therefore fear ye not , than many sparrows ye are of more value . <EOV> <SOV> ' And I say to you , Every one -- whoever may confess with me before men , the Son of Man also shall confess with him before the messengers of God , <EOV> <SOV> and he who hath denied me before men , shall be denied before the messengers of God , <EOV> <SOV> and every one whoever shall say a word to the Son of Man , it shall be forgiven to him , but to him who to the Holy Spirit did speak evil , it shall not be forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when they bring you before the synagogues , and the rulers , and the authorities , be not anxious how or what ye may reply , or what ye may say , <EOV> <SOV> for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in that hour what it behoveth ' you ' to say . ' <EOV> <SOV> And a certain one said to him , out of the multitude , ' Teacher , say to my brother to divide with me the inheritance . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , ' Man , who set me a judge or a divider over you ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' Observe , and beware of the covetousness , because not in the abundance of one 's goods is his life . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a simile unto them , saying , ' Of a certain rich man the field brought forth well ; <EOV> <SOV> and he was reasoning within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have not where I shall gather together my fruits ? <EOV> <SOV> and he said , This I will do , I will take down my storehouses , and greater ones I will build , and I will gather together there all my products and my good things , <EOV> <SOV> and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast many good things laid up for many years , be resting , eat , drink , be merry . <EOV> <SOV> ' And God said to him , Unthinking one ! this night thy soul they shall require from thee , and what things thou didst prepare -- to whom shall they be ? <EOV> <SOV> so ' is ' he who is treasuring up to himself , and is not rich toward God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto his disciples , ' Because of this , to you I say , Be not anxious for your life , what ye may eat ; nor for the body , what ye may put on ; <EOV> <SOV> the life is more than the nourishment , and the body than the clothing . <EOV> <SOV> ' Consider the ravens , that they sow not , nor reap , to which there is no barn nor storehouse , and God doth nourish them ; how much better are ye than the fowls ? <EOV> <SOV> and who of you , being anxious , is able to add to his age one cubit ? <EOV> <SOV> If , then , ye are not able for the least -- why for the rest are ye anxious ? <EOV> <SOV> ' Consider the lilies , how do they grow ? they labour not , nor do they spin , and I say to you , not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these ; <EOV> <SOV> and if the herbage in the field , that to - day is , and to - morrow into an oven is cast , God doth so clothe , how much more you -- ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And ye -- seek not what ye may eat , or what ye may drink , and be not in suspense , <EOV> <SOV> for all these things do the nations of the world seek after , and your Father hath known that ye have need of these things ; <EOV> <SOV> but , seek ye the reign of God , and all these things shall be added to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' Fear not , little flock , because your Father did delight to give you the reign ; <EOV> <SOV> sell your goods , and give alms , make to yourselves bags that become not old , a treasure unfailing in the heavens , where thief doth not come near , nor moth destroy ; <EOV> <SOV> for where your treasure is , there also your heart will be . <EOV> <SOV> ' Let your loins be girded , and the lamps burning , <EOV> <SOV> and ye like to men waiting for their lord , when he shall return out of the wedding feasts , that he having come and knocked , immediately they may open to him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Happy those servants , whom the lord , having come , shall find watching ; verily I say to you , that he will gird himself , and will cause them to recline ( at meat ) , and having come near , will minister to them ; <EOV> <SOV> and if he may come in the second watch , and in the third watch he may come , and may find ' it ' so , happy are those servants . <EOV> <SOV> ' And this know , that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief doth come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken through ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye , then , become ye ready , because at the hour ye think not , the Son of Man doth come . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said to him , ' Sir , unto us this simile dost thou speak , or also unto all ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , ' Who , then , is the faithful and prudent steward whom the lord shall set over his household , to give in season the wheat measure ? <EOV> <SOV> Happy that servant , whom his lord , having come , shall find doing so ; <EOV> <SOV> truly I say to you , that over all his goods he will set him . <EOV> <SOV> ' And if that servant may say in his heart , My lord doth delay to come , and may begin to beat the men - servants and the maid - servants , to eat also , and to drink , and to be drunken ; <EOV> <SOV> the lord of that servant will come in a day in which he doth not look for ' him ' , and in an hour that he doth not know , and will cut him off , and his portion with the unfaithful he will appoint . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that servant , who having known his lord 's will , and not having prepared , nor having gone according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes , <EOV> <SOV> and he who , not having known , and having done things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few ; and to every one to whom much was given , much shall be required from him ; and to whom they did commit much , more abundantly they will ask of him . <EOV> <SOV> ' Fire I came to cast to the earth , and what will I if already it was kindled ? <EOV> <SOV> but I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how am I pressed till it may be completed ! <EOV> <SOV> ' Think ye that peace I came to give in the earth ? no , I say to you , but rather division ; <EOV> <SOV> for there shall be henceforth five in one house divided -- three against two , and two against three ; <EOV> <SOV> a father shall be divided against a son , and a son against a father , a mother against a daughter , and a daughter against a mother , a mother - in - law against her daughter - in - law , and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said also to the multitudes , ' When ye may see the cloud rising from the west , immediately ye say , A shower doth come , and it is so ; <EOV> <SOV> and when -- a south wind blowing , ye say , that there will be heat , and it is ; <EOV> <SOV> hypocrites ! the face of the earth and of the heaven ye have known to make proof of , but this time -- how do ye not make proof of ' it ' ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And why , also , of yourselves , judge ye not what is righteous ? <EOV> <SOV> for , as thou art going away with thy opponent to the ruler , in the way give diligence to be released from him , lest he may drag thee unto the judge , and the judge may deliver thee to the officer , and the officer may cast thee into prison ; <EOV> <SOV> I say to thee , thou mayest not come forth thence till even the last mite thou mayest give back . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And there were present certain at that time , telling him about the Galileans , whose blood Pilate did mingle with their sacrifices ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus answering said to them , ' Think ye that these Galileans became sinners beyond all the Galileans , because they have suffered such things ? <EOV> <SOV> No -- I say to you , but , if ye may not reform , all ye even so shall perish . <EOV> <SOV> ' Or those eighteen , on whom the tower in Siloam fell , and killed them ; think ye that these became debtors beyond all men who are dwelling in Jerusalem ? <EOV> <SOV> No -- I say to you , but , if ye may not reform , all ye in like manner shall perish . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake this simile : ' A certain one had a fig - tree planted in his vineyard , and he came seeking fruit in it , and he did not find ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto the vine - dresser , Lo , three years I come seeking fruit in this fig - tree , and do not find , cut it off , why also the ground doth it render useless ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And he answering saith to him , Sir , suffer it also this year , till that I may dig about it , and cast in dung ; <EOV> <SOV> and if indeed it may bear fruit -- ; and if not so , thereafter thou shalt cut it off . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , there was a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and she was bowed together , and not able to bend back at all , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having seen her , did call ' her ' near , and said to her , ' Woman , thou hast been loosed from thy infirmity ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he laid on her ' his ' hands , and presently she was set upright , and was glorifying God . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief of the synagogue answering -- much displeased that on the sabbath Jesus healed -- said to the multitude , ' Six days there are in which it behoveth ' us ' to be working ; in these , then , coming , be healed , and not on the sabbath - day . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then the Lord answered him and said , ' Hypocrite , doth not each of you on the sabbath loose his ox or ass from the stall , and having led away , doth water ' it ' ? <EOV> <SOV> and this one , being a daughter of Abraham , whom the Adversary bound , lo , eighteen years , did it not behove to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath - day ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he saying these things , all who were opposed to him were being ashamed , and all the multitude were rejoicing over all the glorious things that are being done by him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' To what is the reign of God like ? and to what shall I liken it ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like to a grain of mustard , which a man having taken , did cast into his garden , and it increased , and came to a great tree , and the fowls of the heavens did rest in its branches . ' <EOV> <SOV> And again he said , ' To what shall I liken the reign of God ? <EOV> <SOV> It is like leaven , which a woman , having taken , did hide in three measures of meal , till that all was leavened . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was going through cities and villages , teaching , and making progress toward Jerusalem ; <EOV> <SOV> and a certain one said to him , ' Sir , are those saved few ? ' and he said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> ' Be striving to go in through the straight gate , because many , I say to you , will seek to go in , and shall not be able ; <EOV> <SOV> from the time the master of the house may have risen up , and may have shut the door , and ye may begin without to stand , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , lord , open to us , and he answering shall say to you , I have not known you whence ye are , <EOV> <SOV> then ye may begin to say , We did eat before thee , and did drink , and in our broad places thou didst teach ; <EOV> <SOV> and he shall say , I say to you , I have not known you whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of the unrighteousness . <EOV> <SOV> ' There shall be there the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth , when ye may see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the reign of God , and yourselves being cast out without ; <EOV> <SOV> and they shall come from east and west , and from north and south , and shall recline in the reign of God , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , there are last who shall be first , and there are first who shall be last . ' <EOV> <SOV> On that day there came near certain Pharisees , saying to him , ' Go forth , and be going on hence , for Herod doth wish to kill thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Having gone , say to this fox , Lo , I cast forth demons , and perfect cures to - day and to - morrow , and the third ' day ' I am being perfected ; <EOV> <SOV> but it behoveth me to - day , and to - morrow , and the ' day ' following , to go on , because it is not possible for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> ' Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that is killing the prophets , and stoning those sent unto her , how often did I will to gather together thy children , as a hen her brood under the wings , and ye did not will . <EOV> <SOV> ' Lo , your house is being left to you desolate , and verily I say to you -- ye may not see me , till it may come , when ye may say , Blessed ' is ' he who is coming in the name of the Lord . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , on his going into the house of a certain one of the chiefs of the Pharisees , on a sabbath , to eat bread , that they were watching him , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , there was a certain dropsical man before him ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus answering spake to the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , ' Is it lawful on the sabbath - day to heal ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were silent , and having taken hold of ' him ' , he healed him , and let ' him ' go ; <EOV> <SOV> and answering them he said , ' Of which of you shall an ass or ox fall into a pit , and he will not immediately draw it up on the sabbath - day ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were not able to answer him again unto these things . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a simile unto those called , marking how they were choosing out the first couches , saying unto them , <EOV> <SOV> ' When thou mayest be called by any one to marriage - feasts , thou mayest not recline on the first couch , lest a more honourable than thou may have been called by him , <EOV> <SOV> and he who did call thee and him having come shall say to thee , Give to this one place , and then thou mayest begin with shame to occupy the last place . <EOV> <SOV> ' But , when thou mayest be called , having gone on , recline in the last place , that when he who called thee may come , he may say to thee , Friend , come up higher ; then thou shalt have glory before those reclining with thee ; <EOV> <SOV> because every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled , and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said also to him who did call him , ' When thou mayest make a dinner or a supper , be not calling thy friends , nor thy brethren , nor thy kindred , nor rich neighbours , lest they may also call thee again , and a recompense may come to thee ; <EOV> <SOV> but when thou mayest make a feast , be calling poor , maimed , lame , blind , <EOV> <SOV> and happy thou shalt be , because they have not to recompense thee , for it shall be recompensed to thee in the rising again of the righteous . ' <EOV> <SOV> And one of those reclining with him , having heard these things , said to him , ' Happy ' is ' he who shall eat bread in the reign of God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to him , ' A certain man made a great supper , and called many , <EOV> <SOV> and he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those having been called , Be coming , because now are all things ready . <EOV> <SOV> ' And they began with one consent all to excuse themselves : The first said to him , A field I bought , and I have need to go forth and see it ; I beg of thee , have me excused . <EOV> <SOV> ' And another said , Five yoke of oxen I bought , and I go on to prove them ; I beg of thee , have me excused : <EOV> <SOV> and another said , A wife I married , and because of this I am not able to come . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that servant having come , told to his lord these things , then the master of the house , having been angry , said to his servant , Go forth quickly to the broad places and lanes of the city , and the poor , and maimed , and lame , and blind , bring in hither . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the servant said , Sir , it hath been done as thou didst command , and still there is room . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the lord said unto the servant , Go forth to the ways and hedges , and constrain to come in , that my house may be filled ; <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , that none of those men who have been called shall taste of my supper . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there were going on with him great multitudes , and having turned , he said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> ' If any one doth come unto me , and doth not hate his own father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brothers , and sisters , and yet even his own life , he is not able to be my disciple ; <EOV> <SOV> and whoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , is not able to be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> ' For who of you , willing to build a tower , doth not first , having sat down , count the expense , whether he have the things for completing ? <EOV> <SOV> lest that he having laid a foundation , and not being able to finish , all who are beholding may begin to mock him , <EOV> <SOV> saying -- This man began to build , and was not able to finish . <EOV> <SOV> ' Or what king going on to engage with another king in war , doth not , having sat down , first consult if he be able with ten thousand to meet him who with twenty thousand is coming against him ? <EOV> <SOV> and if not so -- he being yet a long way off -- having sent an embassy , he doth ask the things for peace . <EOV> <SOV> ' So , then , every one of you who doth not take leave of all that he himself hath , is not able to be my disciple . <EOV> <SOV> ' The salt ' is ' good , but if the salt doth become tasteless , with what shall it be seasoned ? <EOV> <SOV> neither for land nor for manure is it fit -- they cast it without . He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And all the tax - gatherers and the sinners were coming nigh to him , to hear him , <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring , saying -- This one doth receive sinners , and doth eat with them . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake unto them this simile , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' What man of you having a hundred sheep , and having lost one out of them , doth not leave behind the ninety - nine in the wilderness , and go on after the lost one , till he may find it ? <EOV> <SOV> and having found , he doth lay ' it ' on his shoulders rejoicing , <EOV> <SOV> and having come to the house , he doth call together the friends and the neighbours , saying to them , Rejoice with me , because I found my sheep -- the lost one . <EOV> <SOV> ' I say to you , that so joy shall be in the heaven over one sinner reforming , rather than over ninety - nine righteous men , who have no need of reformation . <EOV> <SOV> ' Or what woman having ten drachms , if she may lose one drachm , doth not light a lamp , and sweep the house , and seek carefully till that she may find ? <EOV> <SOV> and having found , she doth call together the female friends and the neighbours , saying , Rejoice with me , for I found the drachm that I lost . <EOV> <SOV> ' So I say to you , joy doth come before the messengers of God over one sinner reforming . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' A certain man had two sons , <EOV> <SOV> and the younger of them said to the father , Father , give me the portion of the substance falling to ' me ' , and he divided to them the living . <EOV> <SOV> ' And not many days after , having gathered all together , the younger son went abroad to a far country , and there he scattered his substance , living riotously ; <EOV> <SOV> and he having spent all , there came a mighty famine on that country , and himself began to be in want ; <EOV> <SOV> and having gone on , he joined himself to one of the citizens of that country , and he sent him to the fields to feed swine , <EOV> <SOV> and he was desirous to fill his belly from the husks that the swine were eating , and no one was giving to him . <EOV> <SOV> ' And having come to himself , he said , How many hirelings of my father have a superabundance of bread , and I here with hunger am perishing ! <EOV> <SOV> having risen , I will go on unto my father , and will say to him , Father , I did sin -- to the heaven , and before thee , <EOV> <SOV> and no more am I worthy to be called thy son ; make me as one of thy hirelings . <EOV> <SOV> ' And having risen , he went unto his own father , and he being yet far distant , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and having ran he fell upon his neck and kissed him ; <EOV> <SOV> and the son said to him , Father , I did sin -- to the heaven , and before thee , and no more am I worthy to be called thy son . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the father said unto his servants , Bring forth the first robe , and clothe him , and give a ring for his hand , and sandals for the feet ; <EOV> <SOV> and having brought the fatted calf , kill ' it ' , and having eaten , we may be merry , <EOV> <SOV> because this my son was dead , and did live again , and he was lost , and was found ; and they began to be merry . <EOV> <SOV> ' And his elder son was in a field , and as , coming , he drew nigh to the house , he heard music and dancing , <EOV> <SOV> and having called near one of the young men , he was inquiring what these things might be , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to him -- Thy brother is arrived , and thy father did kill the fatted calf , because in health he did receive him back . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he was angry , and would not go in , therefore his father , having come forth , was entreating him ; <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said to the father , Lo , so many years I do serve thee , and never thy command did I transgress , and to me thou didst never give a kid , that with my friends I might make merry ; <EOV> <SOV> but when thy son -- this one who did devour thy living with harlots -- came , thou didst kill to him the fatted calf . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he said to him , Child , thou art always with me , and all my things are thine ; <EOV> <SOV> but to be merry , and to be glad , it was needful , because this thy brother was dead , and did live again , he was lost , and was found . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said also unto his disciples , ' A certain man was rich , who had a steward , and he was accused to him as scattering his goods ; <EOV> <SOV> and having called him , he said to him , What ' is ' this I hear about thee ? render the account of thy stewardship , for thou mayest not any longer be steward . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the steward said in himself , What shall I do , because my lord doth take away the stewardship from me ? to dig I am not able , to beg I am ashamed : -- <EOV> <SOV> I have known what I shall do , that , when I may be removed from the stewardship , they may receive me to their houses . <EOV> <SOV> ' And having called near each one of his lord 's debtors , he said to the first , How much dost thou owe to my lord ? <EOV> <SOV> and he said , A hundred baths of oil ; and he said to him , Take thy bill , and having sat down write fifty . <EOV> <SOV> ' Afterward to another he said , And thou , how much dost thou owe ? and he said , A hundred cors of wheat ; and he saith to him , Take thy bill , and write eighty . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the lord commended the unrighteous steward that he did prudently , because the sons of this age are more prudent than the sons of the light , in respect to their generation . <EOV> <SOV> and I say to you , Make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness , that when ye may fail , they may receive you to the age - during tabernacles . <EOV> <SOV> ' He who is faithful in the least , ' is ' also faithful in much ; and he who in the least ' is ' unrighteous , is also unrighteous in much ; <EOV> <SOV> if , then , in the unrighteous mammon ye became not faithful -- the true who will entrust to you ? <EOV> <SOV> and if in the other 's ye became not faithful -- your own , who shall give to you ? <EOV> <SOV> ' No domestic is able to serve two lords , for either the one he will hate , and the other he will love ; or one he will hold to , and of the other he will be heedless ; ye are not able to serve God and mammon . ' <EOV> <SOV> And also the Pharisees , being lovers of money , were hearing all these things , and were deriding him , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Ye are those declaring yourselves righteous before men , but God doth know your hearts ; because that which among men is high , ' is ' abomination before God ; <EOV> <SOV> the law and the prophets ' are ' till John ; since then the reign of God is proclaimed good news , and every one doth press into it ; <EOV> <SOV> and it is easier to the heaven and the earth to pass away , than of the law one tittle to fall . <EOV> <SOV> ' Every one who is sending away his wife , and marrying another , doth commit adultery ; and every one who is marrying her sent away from a husband doth commit adultery . <EOV> <SOV> ' And -- a certain man was rich , and was clothed in purple and fine linen , making merry sumptuously every day , <EOV> <SOV> and there was a certain poor man , by name Lazarus , who was laid at his porch , full of sores , <EOV> <SOV> and desiring to be filled from the crumbs that are falling from the table of the rich man ; yea , also the dogs , coming , were licking his sores . <EOV> <SOV> ' And it came to pass , that the poor man died , and that he was carried away by the messengers to the bosom of Abraham -- and the rich man also died , and was buried ; <EOV> <SOV> and in the hades having lifted up his eyes , being in torments , he doth see Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom , <EOV> <SOV> and having cried , he said , Father Abraham , deal kindly with me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and may cool my tongue , because I am distressed in this flame . <EOV> <SOV> ' And Abraham said , Child , remember that thou did receive -- thou -- thy good things in thy life , and Lazarus in like manner the evil things , and now he is comforted , and thou art distressed ; <EOV> <SOV> and besides all these things , between us and you a great chasm is fixed , so that they who are willing to go over from hence unto you are not able , nor do they from thence to us pass through . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he said , I pray thee , then , father , that thou mayest send him to the house of my father , <EOV> <SOV> for I have five brothers , so that he may thoroughly testify to them , that they also may not come to this place of torment . <EOV> <SOV> ' Abraham saith to him , They have Moses and the prophets , let them hear them ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said , No , father Abraham , but if any one from the dead may go unto them , they will reform . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , If Moses and the prophets they do not hear , neither if one may rise out of the dead will they be persuaded . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said unto the disciples , ' It is impossible for the stumbling blocks not to come , but wo ' to him ' through whom they come ; <EOV> <SOV> it is more profitable to him if a weighty millstone is put round about his neck , and he hath been cast into the sea , than that he may cause one of these little ones to stumble . <EOV> <SOV> ' Take heed to yourselves , and , if thy brother may sin in regard to thee , rebuke him , and if he may reform , forgive him , <EOV> <SOV> and if seven times in the day he may sin against thee , and seven times in the day may turn back to thee , saying , I reform ; thou shalt forgive him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles said to the Lord , ' Add to us faith ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and the Lord said , ' If ye had faith as a grain of mustard , ye would have said to this sycamine , Be uprooted , and be planted in the sea , and it would have obeyed you . <EOV> <SOV> ' But , who is he of you -- having a servant ploughing or feeding -- who , to him having come in out of the field , will say , Having come near , recline at meat ? <EOV> <SOV> but will not ' rather ' say to him , Prepare what I may sup , and having girded thyself about , minister to me , till I eat and drink , and after these things thou shalt eat and drink ? <EOV> <SOV> Hath he favour to that servant because he did the things directed ? I think not . <EOV> <SOV> ' So also ye , when ye may have done all the things directed you , say -- We are unprofitable servants , because that which we owed to do -- we have done . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his going on to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and he entering into a certain village , there met him ten leprous men , who stood afar off , <EOV> <SOV> and they lifted up the voice , saying , ' Jesus , master , deal kindly with us ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having seen ' them ' , he said to them , ' Having gone on , shew yourselves to the priests ; ' and it came to pass , in their going , they were cleansed , <EOV> <SOV> and one of them having seen that he was healed did turn back , with a loud voice glorifying God , <EOV> <SOV> and he fell upon ' his ' face at his feet , giving thanks to him , and he was a Samaritan . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , ' Were not the ten cleansed , and the nine -- where ? <EOV> <SOV> There were not found who did turn back to give glory to God , except this alien ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to him , ' Having risen , be going on , thy faith hath saved thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having been questioned by the Pharisees , when the reign of God doth come , he answered them , and said , ' The reign of God doth not come with observation ; <EOV> <SOV> nor shall they say , Lo , here ; or lo , there ; for lo , the reign of God is within you . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto his disciples , ' Days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man , and ye shall not behold ' it ' ; <EOV> <SOV> and they shall say to you , Lo , here ; or lo , there ; ye may not go away , nor follow ; <EOV> <SOV> for as the lightning that is lightening out of the one ' part ' under heaven , to the other part under heaven doth shine , so shall be also the Son of Man in his day ; <EOV> <SOV> and first it behoveth him to suffer many things , and to be rejected by this generation . <EOV> <SOV> ' And , as it came to pass in the days of Noah , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man ; <EOV> <SOV> they were eating , they were drinking , they were marrying , they were given in marriage , till the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the deluge came , and destroyed all ; <EOV> <SOV> in like manner also , as it came to pass in the days of Lot ; they were eating , they were drinking , they were buying , they were selling , they were planting , they were building ; <EOV> <SOV> and on the day Lot went forth from Sodom , He rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed all . <EOV> <SOV> ' According to these things it shall be , in the day the Son of Man is revealed ; <EOV> <SOV> in that day , he who shall be on the house top , and his vessels in the house , let him not come down to take them away ; and he in the field , in like manner , let him not turn backward ; <EOV> <SOV> remember the wife of Lot . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever may seek to save his life , shall lose it ; and whoever may lose it , shall preserve it . <EOV> <SOV> ' I say to you , In that night , there shall be two men on one couch , the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left ; <EOV> <SOV> two women shall be grinding at the same place together , the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left ; <EOV> <SOV> two men shall be in the field , the one shall be taken , and the other left . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they answering say to him , ' Where , sir ? ' and he said to them , ' Where the body ' is ' , there will the eagles be gathered together . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he spake also a simile to them , that it behoveth ' us ' always to pray , and not to faint , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' A certain judge was in a certain city -- God he is not fearing , and man he is not regarding -- <EOV> <SOV> and a widow was in that city , and she was coming unto him , saying , Do me justice on my opponent , <EOV> <SOV> and he would not for a time , but after these things he said in himself , Even if God I do not fear , and man do not regard , <EOV> <SOV> yet because this widow doth give me trouble , I will do her justice , lest , perpetually coming , she may plague me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , ' Hear ye what the unrighteous judge saith : <EOV> <SOV> and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones , who are crying unto Him day and night -- bearing long in regard to them ? <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , that He will execute the justice to them quickly ; but the Son of Man having come , shall he find the faith upon the earth ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous , and have been despising the rest , this simile : <EOV> <SOV> ' Two men went up to the temple to pray , the one a Pharisee , and the other a tax - gatherer ; <EOV> <SOV> the Pharisee having stood by himself , thus prayed : God , I thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men , rapacious , unrighteous , adulterers , or even as this tax - gatherer ; <EOV> <SOV> I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all things -- as many as I possess . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the tax - gatherer , having stood afar off , would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven , but was smiting on his breast , saying , God be propitious to me -- the sinner ! <EOV> <SOV> I say to you , this one went down declared righteous , to his house , rather than that one : for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled , and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were bringing near also the babes , that he may touch them , and the disciples having seen did rebuke them , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having called them near , said , ' Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not , for of such is the reign of God ; <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to you , Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child , may not enter into it . ' <EOV> <SOV> And a certain ruler questioned him , saying , ' Good teacher , what having done -- shall I inherit life age - during ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , ' Why me dost thou call good ? no one ' is ' good , except One -- God ; <EOV> <SOV> the commands thou hast known : Thou mayest not commit adultery , Thou mayest do no murder , Thou mayest not steal , Thou mayest not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' All these I did keep from my youth ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having heard these things , Jesus said to him , ' Yet one thing to thee is lacking ; all things -- as many as thou hast -- sell , and distribute to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , be following me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he , having heard these things , became very sorrowful , for he was exceeding rich . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful , said , ' How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God ! <EOV> <SOV> for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter , than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter . ' <EOV> <SOV> And those who heard , said , ' And who is able to be saved ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' The things impossible with men are possible with God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said , ' Lo , we left all , and did follow thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Verily I say to you , that there is not one who left house , or parents , or brothers , or wife , or children , for the sake of the reign of God , <EOV> <SOV> who may not receive back manifold more in this time , and in the coming age , life age - during . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having taken the twelve aside , he said unto them , ' Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things shall be completed -- that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son of Man , <EOV> <SOV> for he shall be delivered up to the nations , and shall be mocked , and insulted , and spit upon , <EOV> <SOV> and having scourged they shall put him to death , and on the third day he shall rise again . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they none of these things understood , and this saying was hid from them , and they were not knowing the things said . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his coming nigh to Jericho , a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging , <EOV> <SOV> and having heard a multitude going by , he was inquiring what this may be , <EOV> <SOV> and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene doth pass by , <EOV> <SOV> and he cried out , saying , ' Jesus , Son of David , deal kindly with me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and those going before were rebuking him , that he might be silent , but he was much more crying out , ' Son of David , deal kindly with me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having stood , commanded him to be brought unto him , and he having come nigh , he questioned him , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' What wilt thou I shall do to thee ? ' and he said , ' Sir , that I may receive sight . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , ' Receive thy sight ; thy faith hath saved thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and presently he did receive sight , and was following him , glorifying God ; and all the people , having seen , did give praise to God . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having entered , he was passing through Jericho , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a man , by name called Zaccheus , and he was a chief tax - gatherer , and he was rich , <EOV> <SOV> and he was seeking to see Jesus , who he is , and was not able for the multitude , because in stature he was small , <EOV> <SOV> and having run forward before , he went up on a sycamore , that he may see him , because through that ' way ' he was about to pass by . <EOV> <SOV> And as Jesus came up to the place , having looked up , he saw him , and said unto him , ' Zaccheus , having hastened , come down , for to - day in thy house it behoveth me to remain ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he having hastened did come down , and did receive him rejoicing ; <EOV> <SOV> and having seen ' it ' , they were all murmuring , saying -- ' With a sinful man he went in to lodge ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And Zaccheus having stood , said unto the Lord , ' Lo , the half of my goods , sir , I give to the poor , and if of any one anything I did take by false accusation , I give back fourfold . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him -- ' To - day salvation did come to this house , inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham ; <EOV> <SOV> for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while they are hearing these things , having added he spake a simile , because of his being nigh to Jerusalem , and of their thinking that the reign of God is about presently to be made manifest . <EOV> <SOV> He said therefore , ' A certain man of birth went on to a far country , to take to himself a kingdom , and to return , <EOV> <SOV> and having called ten servants of his own , he gave to them ten pounds , and said unto them , Do business -- till I come ; <EOV> <SOV> and his citizens were hating him , and did send an embassy after him , saying , We do not wish this one to reign over us . <EOV> <SOV> ' And it came to pass , on his coming back , having taken the kingdom , that he commanded these servants to be called to him , to whom he gave the money , that he might know what any one had done in business . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the first came near , saying , Sir , thy pound did gain ten pounds ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said to him , Well done , good servant , because in a very little thou didst become faithful , be having authority over ten cities . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the second came , saying , Sir , thy pound made five pounds ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said also to this one , And thou , become thou over five cities . <EOV> <SOV> ' And another came , saying , Sir , lo , thy pound , that I had lying away in a napkin ; <EOV> <SOV> for I was afraid of thee , because thou art an austere man ; thou takest up what thou didst not lay down , and reapest what thou didst not sow . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he saith to him , Out of thy mouth I will judge thee , evil servant : thou knewest that I am an austere man , taking up what I did not lay down , and reaping what I did not sow ! <EOV> <SOV> and wherefore didst thou not give my money to the bank , and I , having come , with interest might have received it ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And to those standing by he said , Take from him the pound , and give to him having the ten pounds -- <EOV> <SOV> ( and they said to him , Sir , he hath ten pounds ) -- <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , that to every one having shall be given , and from him not having , also what he hath shall be taken from him , <EOV> <SOV> but those my enemies , who did not wish me to reign over them , bring hither and slay before me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having said these things , he went on before , going up to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he came nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , unto the mount called of the Olives , he sent two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> having said , Go away to the village over - against , in which , entering into , ye shall find a colt bound , on which no one of men did ever sit , having loosed it , bring ' it ' ; <EOV> <SOV> and if any one doth question you , Wherefore do ye loose ' it ' ? thus ye shall say to him -- The Lord hath need of it . ' <EOV> <SOV> And those sent , having gone away , found according as he said to them , <EOV> <SOV> and while they are loosing the colt , its owners said unto them , ' Why loose ye the colt ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said , ' The Lord hath need of it ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they brought it unto Jesus , and having cast their garments upon the colt , they did set Jesus upon it . <EOV> <SOV> And as he is going , they were spreading their garments in the way , <EOV> <SOV> and as he is coming nigh now , at the descent of the mount of the Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty works they had seen , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' blessed ' is ' he who is coming , a king in the name of the Lord ; peace in heaven , and glory in the highest . ' <EOV> <SOV> And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him , ' Teacher , rebuke thy disciples ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said to them , ' I say to you , that , if these shall be silent , the stones will cry out ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And when he came nigh , having seen the city , he wept over it , <EOV> <SOV> saying -- ' If thou didst know , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things for thy peace ; but now they were hid from thine eyes . <EOV> <SOV> ' Because days shall come upon thee , and thine enemies shall cast around thee a rampart , and compass thee round , and press thee on every side , <EOV> <SOV> and lay thee low , and thy children within thee , and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone , because thou didst not know the time of thy inspection . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having entered into the temple , he began to cast forth those selling in it , and those buying , <EOV> <SOV> saying to them , ' It hath been written , My house is a house of prayer -- but ye made it a den of robbers . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was teaching daily in the temple , but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him -- also the chiefs of the people -- <EOV> <SOV> and they were not finding what they shall do , for all the people were hanging on him , hearing him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , on one of those days , as he is teaching the people in the temple , and proclaiming good news , the chief priests and the scribes , with the elders , came upon ' him ' , <EOV> <SOV> and spake unto him , saying , ' Tell us by what authority thou dost these things ? or who is he that gave to thee this authority ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said unto them , ' I will question you -- I also -- one thing , and tell me : <EOV> <SOV> the baptism of John , from heaven was it , or from men ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned with themselves , saying -- ' If we may say , From heaven , he will say , Wherefore , then , did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> and if we may say , From men , all the people will stone us , for they are having been persuaded John to be a prophet . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they answered , that they knew not whence ' it was ' , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to them , ' Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he began to speak unto the people this simile : ' A certain man planted a vineyard , and gave it out to husbandmen , and went abroad for a long time , <EOV> <SOV> and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant , that from the fruit of the vineyard they may give to him , but the husbandmen having beat him , did send ' him ' away empty . <EOV> <SOV> ' And he added to send another servant , and they that one also having beaten and dishonoured , did send away empty ; <EOV> <SOV> and he added to send a third , and this one also , having wounded , they did cast out . <EOV> <SOV> ' And the owner of the vineyard said , What shall I do ? I will send my son -- the beloved , perhaps having seen this one , they will do reverence ; <EOV> <SOV> and having seen him , the husbandmen reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir ; come , we may kill him , that the inheritance may become ours ; <EOV> <SOV> and having cast him outside of the vineyard , they killed ' him ' ; what , then , shall the owner of the vineyard do to them ? <EOV> <SOV> He will come , and destroy these husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . ' And having heard , they said , ' Let it not be ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and he , having looked upon them , said , ' What , then , is this that hath been written : A stone that the builders rejected -- this became head of a corner ? <EOV> <SOV> every one who hath fallen on that stone shall be broken , and on whom it may fall , it will crush him to pieces . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him in that hour , and they feared the people , for they knew that against them he spake this simile . <EOV> <SOV> And , having watched ' him ' , they sent forth liers in wait , feigning themselves to be righteous , that they might take hold of his word , to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor , <EOV> <SOV> and they questioned him , saying , ' Teacher , we have known that thou dost say and teach rightly , and dost not accept a person , but in truth the way of God dost teach ; <EOV> <SOV> Is it lawful to us to give tribute to Caesar or not ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , having perceived their craftiness , said unto them , ' Why me do ye tempt ? <EOV> <SOV> shew me a denary ; of whom hath it an image and superscription ? ' and they answering said , ' Of Caesar : ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Give back , therefore , the things of Caesar to Caesar , and the things of God to God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were not able to take hold on his saying before the people , and having wondered at his answer , they were silent . <EOV> <SOV> And certain of the Sadducees , who are denying that there is a rising again , having come near , questioned him , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Teacher , Moses wrote to us , If any one 's brother may die , having a wife , and he may die childless -- that his brother may take the wife , and may raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> ' There were , then , seven brothers , and the first having taken a wife , died childless , <EOV> <SOV> and the second took the wife , and he died childless , <EOV> <SOV> and the third took her , and in like manner also the seven -- they left not children , and they died ; <EOV> <SOV> and last of all died also the woman : <EOV> <SOV> in the rising again , then , of which of them doth she become wife ? -- for the seven had her as wife . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' The sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage , <EOV> <SOV> but those accounted worthy to obtain that age , and the rising again that is out of the dead , neither marry , nor are they given in marriage ; <EOV> <SOV> for neither are they able to die any more -- for they are like messengers -- and they are sons of God , being sons of the rising again . <EOV> <SOV> ' And that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the Bush , since he doth call the Lord , the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ; <EOV> <SOV> and He is not a God of dead men , but of living , for all live to Him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And certain of the scribes answering said , ' Teacher , thou didst say well ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and no more durst they question him anything . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' How do they say the Christ to be son of David , <EOV> <SOV> and David himself saith in the Book of Psalms , The Lord said to my lord , Sit thou on my right hand , <EOV> <SOV> till I shall make thine enemies thy footstool ; <EOV> <SOV> David , then , doth call him lord , and how is he his son ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And , all the people hearing , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> ' Take heed of the scribes , who are wishing to walk in long robes , and are loving salutations in the markets , and first seats in the synagogues , and first couches in the suppers , <EOV> <SOV> who devour the houses of the widows , and for a pretence make long prayers , these shall receive more abundant judgment . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having looked up , he saw those who did cast their gifts to the treasury -- rich men , <EOV> <SOV> and he saw also a certain poor widow casting there two mites , <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' Truly I say to you , that this poor widow did cast in more than all ; <EOV> <SOV> for all these out of their superabundance did cast into the gifts to God , but this one out of her want , all the living that she had , did cast in . ' <EOV> <SOV> And certain saying about the temple , that with goodly stones and devoted things it hath been adorned , he said , <EOV> <SOV> ' These things that ye behold -- days will come , in which there shall not be left a stone upon a stone , that shall not be thrown down . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they questioned him , saying , ' Teacher , when , then , shall these things be ? and what ' is ' the sign when these things may be about to happen ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' See -- ye may not be led astray , for many shall come in my name , saying -- I am ' he ' , and the time hath come nigh ; go not on then after them ; <EOV> <SOV> and when ye may hear of wars and uprisings , be not terrified , for it behoveth these things to happen first , but the end ' is ' not immediately . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to them , ' Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , <EOV> <SOV> great shakings also in every place , and famines , and pestilences , there shall be ; fearful things also , and great signs from heaven there shall be ; <EOV> <SOV> and before all these , they shall lay on you their hands , and persecute , delivering up to synagogues and prisons , being brought before kings and governors for my name 's sake ; <EOV> <SOV> and it shall become to you for a testimony . <EOV> <SOV> ' Settle , then , to your hearts , not to meditate beforehand to reply , <EOV> <SOV> for I will give to you a mouth and wisdom that all your opposers shall not be able to refute or resist . <EOV> <SOV> ' And ye shall be delivered up also by parents , and brothers , and kindred , and friends , and they shall put of you to death ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall be hated by all because of my name -- <EOV> <SOV> and a hair out of your head shall not perish ; <EOV> <SOV> in your patience possess ye your souls . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when ye may see Jerusalem surrounded by encampments , then know that come nigh did her desolation ; <EOV> <SOV> then those in Judea , let them flee to the mountains ; and those in her midst , let them depart out ; and those in the countries , let them not come in to her ; <EOV> <SOV> because these are days of vengeance , to fulfil all things that have been written . <EOV> <SOV> ' And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck , in those days ; for there shall be great distress on the land , and wrath on this people ; <EOV> <SOV> and they shall fall by the mouth of the sword , and shall be led captive to all the nations , and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by nations , till the times of nations be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> ' And there shall be signs in sun , and moon , and stars , and on the land ' is ' distress of nations with perplexity , sea and billow roaring ; <EOV> <SOV> men fainting at heart from fear , and expectation of the things coming on the world , for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> ' And then they shall see the Son of Man , coming in a cloud , with power and much glory ; <EOV> <SOV> and these things beginning to happen bend yourselves back , and lift up your heads , because your redemption doth draw nigh . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake a simile to them : ' See the fig - tree , and all the trees , <EOV> <SOV> when they may now cast forth , having seen , of yourselves ye know that now is the summer nigh ; <EOV> <SOV> so also ye , when ye may see these things happening , ye know that near is the reign of God ; <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to you -- This generation may not pass away till all may have come to pass ; <EOV> <SOV> the heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words may not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> ' And take heed to yourselves , lest your hearts may be weighed down with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and anxieties of life , and suddenly that day may come on you , <EOV> <SOV> for as a snare it shall come on all those dwelling on the face of all the land , <EOV> <SOV> watch ye , then , in every season , praying that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that are about to come to pass , and to stand before the Son of Man . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was during the days in the temple teaching , and during the nights , going forth , he was lodging at the mount called of Olives ; <EOV> <SOV> and all the people were coming early unto him in the temple to hear him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the feast of the unleavened food was coming nigh , that is called Passover , <EOV> <SOV> and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up , for they were afraid of the people . <EOV> <SOV> And the Adversary entered into Judas , who is surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve , <EOV> <SOV> and he , having gone away , spake with the chief priests and the magistrates , how he might deliver him up to them , <EOV> <SOV> and they rejoiced , and covenanted to give him money , <EOV> <SOV> and he agreed , and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult . <EOV> <SOV> And the day of the unleavened food came , in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed , <EOV> <SOV> and he sent Peter and John , saying , ' Having gone on , prepare to us the passover , that we may eat ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said to him , ' Where wilt thou that we might prepare ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Lo , in your entering into the city , there shall meet you a man , bearing a pitcher of water , follow him to the house where he doth go in , <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall say to the master of the house , The Teacher saith to thee , Where is the guest - chamber where the passover with my disciples I may eat ? <EOV> <SOV> and he shall show you a large upper room furnished , there make ready ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they , having gone away , found as he hath said to them , and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And when the hour come , he reclined ( at meat ) , and the twelve apostles with him , <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto them , ' With desire I did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering , <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , that no more may I eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having taken a cup , having given thanks , he said , ' Take this and divide to yourselves , <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having taken bread , having given thanks , he brake and gave to them , saying , ' This is my body , that for you is being given , this do ye -- to remembrance of me . ' <EOV> <SOV> In like manner , also , the cup after the supping , saying , ' This cup ' is ' the new covenant in my blood , that for you is being poured forth . <EOV> <SOV> ' But , lo , the hand of him delivering me up ' is ' with me on the table , <EOV> <SOV> and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined ; but wo to that man through whom he is being delivered up . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they began to reason among themselves , who then of them it may be , who is about to do this thing . <EOV> <SOV> And there happened also a strife among them -- who of them is accounted to be greater . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' The kings of the nations do exercise lordship over them , and those exercising authority upon them are called benefactors ; <EOV> <SOV> but ye ' are ' not so , but he who is greater among you -- let him be as the younger ; and he who is leading , as he who is ministering ; <EOV> <SOV> for who is greater ? he who is reclining ( at meat ) , or he who is ministering ? is it not he who is reclining ( at meat ) ? and I -- I am in your midst as he who is ministering . <EOV> <SOV> ' And ye -- ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations , <EOV> <SOV> and I appoint to you , as my Father did appoint to me , a kingdom , <EOV> <SOV> that ye may eat and may drink at my table , in my kingdom , and may sit on thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord said , ' Simon , Simon , lo , the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat , <EOV> <SOV> and I besought for thee , that thy faith may not fail ; and thou , when thou didst turn , strengthen thy brethren . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , ' Sir , with thee I am ready both to prison and to death to go ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' I say to thee , Peter , a cock shall not crow to - day , before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' When I sent you without bag , and scrip , and sandals , did ye lack anything ? ' and they said , ' Nothing . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to them , ' But , now , he who is having a bag , let him take ' it ' up , and in like manner also a scrip ; and he who is not having , let him sell his garment , and buy a sword , <EOV> <SOV> for I say to you , that yet this that hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me : And with lawless ones he was reckoned , for also the things concerning me have an end . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they said , ' Sir , lo , here ' are ' two swords ; ' and he said to them , ' It is sufficient . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having gone forth , he went on , according to custom , to the mount of the Olives , and his disciples also followed him , <EOV> <SOV> and having come to the place , he said to them , ' Pray ye not to enter into temptation . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was withdrawn from them , as it were a stone 's cast , and having fallen on the knees he was praying , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Father , if Thou be counselling to make this cup pass from me -- ; but , not my will , but Thine be done . ' -- <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him ; <EOV> <SOV> and having been in agony , he was more earnestly praying , and his sweat became , as it were , great drops of blood falling upon the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And having risen up from the prayer , having come unto the disciples , he found them sleeping from the sorrow , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Why do ye sleep ? having risen , pray that ye may not enter into temptation . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while he is speaking , lo , a multitude , and he who is called Judas , one of the twelve , was coming before them , and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to him , ' Judas , with a kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And those about him , having seen what was about to be , said to him , ' Sir , shall we smite with a sword ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest , and took off his right ear , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus answering said , ' Suffer ye thus far , ' and having touched his ear , he healed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to those having come upon him -- chief priests , and magistrates of the temple , and elders -- ' As upon a robber have ye come forth , with swords and sticks ? <EOV> <SOV> while daily I was with you in the temple , ye did stretch forth no hands against me ; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having taken him , they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest . And Peter was following afar off , <EOV> <SOV> and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court , and having sat down together , Peter was sitting in the midst of them , <EOV> <SOV> and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light , and having earnestly looked at him , she said , ' And this one was with him ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and he disowned him , saying , ' Woman , I have not known him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And after a little , another having seen him , said , ' And thou art of them ! ' and Peter said , ' Man , I am not . ' <EOV> <SOV> And one hour , as it were , having intervened , a certain other was confidently affirming , saying , ' Of a truth this one also was with him , for he is also a Galilean ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Peter said , ' Man , I have not known what thou sayest ; ' and presently , while he is speaking , a cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And the Lord having turned did look on Peter , and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he said to him -- ' Before a cock shall crow , thou mayest disown me thrice ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Peter having gone without , wept bitterly . <EOV> <SOV> And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him , beating ' him ' ; <EOV> <SOV> and having blindfolded him , they were striking him on the face , and were questioning him , saying , ' Prophesy who he is who smote thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and many other things , speaking evilly , they spake in regard to him . <EOV> <SOV> And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people , chief priests also , and scribes , and they led him up to their own sanhedrim , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' If thou be the Christ , tell us . ' And he said to them , ' If I may tell you , ye will not believe ; <EOV> <SOV> and if I also question ' you ' , ye will not answer me or send me away ; <EOV> <SOV> henceforth , there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they all said , ' Thou , then , art the Son of God ? ' and he said unto them , ' Ye say ' it ' , because I am ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said , ' What need yet have we of testimony ? for we ourselves did hear ' it ' from his mouth . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having risen , the whole multitude of them did lead him to Pilate , <EOV> <SOV> and began to accuse him , saying , ' This one we found perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying himself to be Christ a king . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate questioned him , saying , ' Thou art the king of the Jews ? ' and he answering him , said , ' Thou dost say ' it ' . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said unto the chief priests , and the multitude , ' I find no fault in this man ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were the more urgent , saying -- ' He doth stir up the people , teaching throughout the whole of Judea -- having begun from Galilee -- unto this place . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate having heard of Galilee , questioned if the man is a Galilean , <EOV> <SOV> and having known that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod , he sent him back unto Herod , he being also in Jerusalem in those days . <EOV> <SOV> And Herod having seen Jesus did rejoice exceedingly , for he was wishing for a long ' time ' to see him , because of hearing many things about him , and he was hoping some sign to see done by him , <EOV> <SOV> and was questioning him in many words , and he answered him nothing . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him , <EOV> <SOV> and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought , and having mocked , having put around him gorgeous apparel , did send him back to Pilate , <EOV> <SOV> and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another , for they were before at enmity between themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate having called together the chief priests , and the rulers , and the people , <EOV> <SOV> said unto them , ' Ye brought to me this man as perverting the people , and lo , I before you having examined , found in this man no fault in those things ye bring forward against him ; <EOV> <SOV> no , nor yet Herod , for I sent you back unto him , and lo , nothing worthy of death is having been done by him ; <EOV> <SOV> having chastised , therefore , I will release him , ' <EOV> <SOV> for it was necessary for him to release to them one at every feast , <EOV> <SOV> and they cried out -- the whole multitude -- saying , ' Away with this one , and release to us Barabbas , ' <EOV> <SOV> who had been , because of a certain sedition made in the city , and murder , cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to them , <EOV> <SOV> but they were calling out , saying , ' Crucify , crucify him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he a third time said unto them , ' Why , what evil did he ? no cause of death did I find in him ; having chastised him , then , I will release ' him ' . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be crucified , and their voices , and those of the chief priests , were prevailing , <EOV> <SOV> and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done , <EOV> <SOV> and he released him who because of sedition and murder hath been cast into the prison , whom they were asking , and Jesus he gave up to their will . <EOV> <SOV> And as they led him away , having taken hold on Simon , a certain Cyrenian , coming from the field , they put on him the cross , to bear ' it ' behind Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And there was following him a great multitude of the people , and of women , who also were beating themselves and lamenting him , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having turned unto them , said , ' Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but for yourselves weep ye , and for your children ; <EOV> <SOV> for , lo , days do come , in which they shall say , Happy the barren , and wombs that did not bare , and paps that did not give suck ; <EOV> <SOV> then they shall begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us , and to the hills , Cover us ; -- <EOV> <SOV> for , if in the green tree they do these things -- in the dry what may happen ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And there were also others -- two evil - doers -- with him , to be put to death ; <EOV> <SOV> and when they came to the place that is called Skull , there they crucified him and the evil - doers , one on the right hand and one on the left . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' Father , forgive them , for they have not known what they do ; ' and parting his garments they cast a lot . <EOV> <SOV> And the people were standing , looking on , and the rulers also were sneering with them , saying , ' Others he saved , let him save himself , if this be the Christ , the choice one of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And mocking him also were the soldiers , coming near and offering vinegar to him , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , ' If thou be the king of the Jews , save thyself . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there was also a superscription written over him , in letters of Greek , and Roman , and Hebrew , ' This is the King of the Jews . ' <EOV> <SOV> And one of the evil - doers who were hanged , was speaking evil of him , saying , ' If thou be the Christ , save thyself and us . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the other answering , was rebuking him , saying , ' Dost thou not even fear God , that thou art in the same judgment ? <EOV> <SOV> and we indeed righteously , for things worthy of what we did we receive back , but this one did nothing out of place ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to Jesus , ' Remember me , lord , when thou mayest come in thy reign ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to him , ' Verily I say to thee , To - day with me thou shalt be in the paradise . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it was , as it were , the sixth hour , and darkness came over all the land till the ninth hour , <EOV> <SOV> and the sun was darkened , and the vail of the sanctuary was rent in the midst , <EOV> <SOV> and having cried with a loud voice , Jesus said , ' Father , to Thy hands I commit my spirit ; ' and these things having said , he breathed forth the spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And the centurion having seen what was done , did glorify God , saying , ' Really this man was righteous ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and all the multitudes who were come together to this sight , beholding the things that came to pass , smiting their breasts did turn back ; <EOV> <SOV> and all his acquaintances stood afar off , and women who did follow him from Galilee , beholding these things . <EOV> <SOV> And lo , a man , by name Joseph , being a counsellor , a man good and righteous , <EOV> <SOV> -- he was not consenting to their counsel and deed -- from Arimathea , a city of the Jews , who also himself was expecting the reign of God , <EOV> <SOV> he , having gone near to Pilate , asked the body of Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> and having taken it down , he wrapped it in fine linen , and placed it in a tomb hewn out , where no one was yet laid . <EOV> <SOV> And the day was a preparation , and sabbath was approaching , <EOV> <SOV> and the women also who have come with him out of Galilee having followed after , beheld the tomb , and how his body was placed , <EOV> <SOV> and having turned back , they made ready spices and ointments , and on the sabbath , indeed , they rested , according to the command . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And on the first of the sabbaths , at early dawn , they came to the tomb , bearing the spices they made ready , and certain ' others ' with them , <EOV> <SOV> and they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb , <EOV> <SOV> and having gone in , they found not the body of the Lord Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , while they are perplexed about this , that lo , two men stood by them in glittering apparel , <EOV> <SOV> and on their having become afraid , and having inclined the face to the earth , they said to them , ' Why do ye seek the living with the dead ? <EOV> <SOV> he is not here , but was raised ; remember how he spake to you , being yet in Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> saying -- It behoveth the Son of Man to be delivered up to the hands of sinful men , and to be crucified , and the third day to rise again . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they remembered his sayings , <EOV> <SOV> and having turned back from the tomb told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest . <EOV> <SOV> And it was the Magdalene Mary , and Joanna , and Mary of James , and the other women with them , who told unto the apostles these things , <EOV> <SOV> and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk , and they were not believing them . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter having risen , did run to the tomb , and having stooped down he seeth the linen clothes lying alone , and he went away to his own home , wondering at that which was come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And , lo , two of them were going on during that day to a village , distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem , the name of which ' is ' Emmaus , <EOV> <SOV> and they were conversing with one another about all these things that have happened . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning together , that Jesus himself , having come nigh , was going on with them , <EOV> <SOV> and their eyes were holden so as not to know him , <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto them , ' What ' are ' these words that ye exchange with one another , walking , and ye are sad ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And the one , whose name was Cleopas , answering , said unto him , ' Art thou alone such a stranger in Jerusalem , that thou hast not known the things that came to pass in it in these days ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' What things ? ' And they said to him , ' The things about Jesus of Nazareth , who became a man -- a prophet -- powerful in deed and word , before God and all the people , <EOV> <SOV> how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death , and crucified him ; <EOV> <SOV> and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel , and also with all these things , this third day is passing to - day , since these things happened . <EOV> <SOV> ' And certain women of ours also astonished us , coming early to the tomb , <EOV> <SOV> and not having found his body , they came , saying also to have seen an apparition of messengers , who say he is alive , <EOV> <SOV> and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb , and found as even the women said , and him they saw not . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , ' O inconsiderate and slow in heart , to believe on all that the prophets spake ! <EOV> <SOV> Was it not behoving the Christ these things to suffer , and to enter into his glory ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and having begun from Moses , and from all the prophets , he was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about himself . <EOV> <SOV> And they came nigh to the village whither they were going , and he made an appearance of going on further , <EOV> <SOV> and they constrained him , saying , ' Remain with us , for it is toward evening , ' and the day did decline , and he went in to remain with them . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his reclining ( at meat ) with them , having taken the bread , he blessed , and having broken , he was giving to them , <EOV> <SOV> and their eyes were opened , and they recognized him , and he became unseen by them . <EOV> <SOV> And they said one to another , ' Was not our heart burning within us , as he was speaking to us in the way , and as he was opening up to us the Writings ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And they , having risen up the same hour , turned back to Jerusalem , and found gathered together the eleven , and those with them , <EOV> <SOV> saying -- ' The Lord was raised indeed , and was seen by Simon ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were telling the things in the way , and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread , <EOV> <SOV> and as they are speaking these things , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith to them , ' Peace -- to you ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and being amazed , and becoming affrighted , they were thinking themselves to see a spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Why are ye troubled ? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> see my hands and my feet , that I am he ; handle me and see , because a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me having . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having said this , he shewed to them the hands and the feet , <EOV> <SOV> and while they are not believing from the joy , and wondering , he said to them , ' Have ye anything here to eat ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they gave to him part of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb , <EOV> <SOV> and having taken , he did eat before them , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' These ' are ' the words that I spake unto you , being yet with you , that it behoveth to be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses , and the Prophets , and the Psalms , about me . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them -- ' Thus it hath been written , and thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer , and to rise out of the dead the third day , <EOV> <SOV> and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem : <EOV> <SOV> and ye -- ye are witnesses of these things . <EOV> <SOV> ' And , lo , I do send the promise of my Father upon you , but ye -- abide ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye be clothed with power from on high . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he led them forth without -- unto Bethany , and having lifted up his hands he did bless them , <EOV> <SOV> and it came to pass , in his blessing them , he was parted from them , and was borne up to the heaven ; <EOV> <SOV> and they , having bowed before him , did turn back to Jerusalem with great joy , <EOV> <SOV> and were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
