<SOC> <SOV> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren ; <EOV> <SOV> and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar ; and Perez begat Hezron ; and Hezron begat Ram ; <EOV> <SOV> and Ram begat Amminadab ; and Amminadab begat Nahshon ; and Nahshon begat Salmon ; <EOV> <SOV> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab ; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jesse begat David the king . And David begat Solomon of her ' that had been the wife ' of Uriah ; <EOV> <SOV> and Solomon begat Rehoboam ; and Rehoboam begat Abijah ; and Abijah begat Asa ; <EOV> <SOV> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat ; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Uzziah ; <EOV> <SOV> and Uzziah begat Jotham ; and Jotham begat Ahaz ; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah ; <EOV> <SOV> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh ; and Manasseh begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josiah ; <EOV> <SOV> and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren , at the time of the carrying away to Babylon . <EOV> <SOV> And after the carrying away to Babylon , Jechoniah begat Shealtiel ; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel ; <EOV> <SOV> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ; <EOV> <SOV> and Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ; <EOV> <SOV> and Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ; <EOV> <SOV> and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ . <EOV> <SOV> So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations ; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations . <EOV> <SOV> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph , before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , was minded to put her away privily . <EOV> <SOV> But when he thought on these things , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And she shall bring forth a son ; and thou shalt call his name JESUS ; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins . <EOV> <SOV> Now all this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Behold , the virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , And they shall call his name Immanuel ; which is , being interpreted , God with us . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took unto him his wife ; <EOV> <SOV> and knew her not till she had brought forth a son : and he called his name JESUS . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king , behold , Wise - men from the east came to Jerusalem , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we saw his star in the east , and are come to worship him . <EOV> <SOV> And when Herod the king heard it , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him . <EOV> <SOV> And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where the Christ should be born . <EOV> <SOV> And they said unto him , In Bethlehem of Judaea : for thus it is written through the prophet , <EOV> <SOV> And thou Bethlehem , land of Judah , Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah : For out of thee shall come forth a governor , Who shall be shepherd of my people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod privily called the Wise - men , and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search out exactly concerning the young child ; and when ye have found ' him , ' bring me word , that I also may come and worship him . <EOV> <SOV> And they , having heard the king , went their way ; and lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy . <EOV> <SOV> And they came into the house and saw the young child with Mary his mother ; and they fell down and worshipped him ; and opening their treasures they offered unto him gifts , gold and frankincense and myrrh . <EOV> <SOV> And being warned ' of God ' in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way . <EOV> <SOV> Now when they were departed , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I tell thee : for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose and took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt ; <EOV> <SOV> and was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt did I call my son . <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the Wise - men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the male children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the borders thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had exactly learned of the Wise - men . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> A voice was heard in Ramah , Weeping and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children ; And she would not be comforted , because they are not . <EOV> <SOV> But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Arise and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead that sought the young child 's life . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither ; and being warned ' of God ' in a dream , he withdrew into the parts of Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets , that he should be called a Nazarene . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And in those days cometh John the Baptist , preaching in the wilderness of Judaea , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Repent ye ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> For this is he that was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make ye ready the way of the Lord , Make his paths straight . <EOV> <SOV> Now John himself had his raiment of camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his food was locusts and wild honey . <EOV> <SOV> Then went out unto him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about the Jordan ; <EOV> <SOV> and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism , he said unto them , Ye offspring of vipers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? <EOV> <SOV> Bring forth therefore fruit worthy of repentance : <EOV> <SOV> and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And even now the axe lieth at the root of the trees : every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and ' in ' fire : <EOV> <SOV> whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing - floor ; and he will gather his wheat into the garner , but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him . <EOV> <SOV> But John would have hindered him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer ' it ' now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffereth him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus when he was baptized , went up straightway from the water : and lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove , and coming upon him ; <EOV> <SOV> and lo , a voice out of the heavens , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he afterward hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And the tempter came and said unto him , If thou art the Son of God , command that these stones become bread . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then the devil taketh him into the holy city ; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple , <EOV> <SOV> and saith unto him , If thou art the Son of God , cast thyself down : for it is written , He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and , On their hands they shall bear thee up , Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto him , Again it is written , Thou shalt not make trial of the Lord thy God . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain , and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve . <EOV> <SOV> Then the devil leaveth him ; and behold , angels came and ministered unto him . <EOV> <SOV> Now when he heard that John was delivered up , he withdrew into Galilee ; <EOV> <SOV> and leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is by the sea , in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali : <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali , Toward the sea , beyond the Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles , <EOV> <SOV> The people that sat in darkness Saw a great light , And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death , To them did light spring up . <EOV> <SOV> From that time began Jesus to preach , and to say , Repent ye ; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> And walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw two brethren , Simon who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea ; for they were fishers . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you fishers of men . <EOV> <SOV> And they straightway left the nets , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And going on from thence he saw two other brethren , James the ' son ' of Zebedee , and John his brother , in the boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them . <EOV> <SOV> And they straightway left the boat and their father , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went about in all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people . <EOV> <SOV> And the report of him went forth into all Syria : and they brought unto him all that were sick , holden with divers diseases and torments , possessed with demons , and epileptic , and palsied ; and he healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and ' from ' beyond the Jordan . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And seeing the multitudes , he went up into the mountain : and when he had sat down , his disciples came unto him : <EOV> <SOV> and he opened his mouth and taught them , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called sons of God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye when ' men ' shall reproach you , and persecute you , and say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake . <EOV> <SOV> Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost its savor , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are the light of the world . A city set on a hill can not be hid . <EOV> <SOV> Neither do ' men ' light a lamp , and put it under the bushel , but on the stand ; and it shineth unto all that are in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Even so let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets : I came not to destroy , but to fulfil . <EOV> <SOV> For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass away , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law , till all things be accomplished . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , that except your righteousness shall exceed ' the righteousness ' of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment : <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you , that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment ; and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council ; and whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of the hell of fire . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee , <EOV> <SOV> leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way , first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift . <EOV> <SOV> Agree with thine adversary quickly , while thou art with him in the way ; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou have paid the last farthing . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it was said , Thou shalt not commit adultery : <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you , that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not thy whole body be cast into hell . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not thy whole body go into hell . <EOV> <SOV> It was said also , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement : <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you , that every one that putteth away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , maketh her an adulteress : and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> Again , ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths : <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you , swear not at all ; neither by the heaven , for it is the throne of God ; <EOV> <SOV> nor by the earth , for it is the footstool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King . <EOV> <SOV> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , for thou canst not make one hair white or black . <EOV> <SOV> But let your speech be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil ' one ' . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth : <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you , resist not him that is evil : but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man would go to law with thee , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile , go with him two . <EOV> <SOV> Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it was said , Thou shalt love thy neighbor , and hate thine enemy : <EOV> <SOV> but I say unto you , love your enemies , and pray for them that persecute you ; <EOV> <SOV> that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good , and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust . <EOV> <SOV> For if ye love them that love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ? <EOV> <SOV> And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more ' than others ? ' do not even the Gentiles the same ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye therefore shall be perfect , as your heavenly Father is perfect . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men , to be seen of them : else ye have no reward with your Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore thou doest alms , sound not a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily I say unto you , They have received their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth : <EOV> <SOV> that thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye pray , ye shall not be as the hypocrites : for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , They have received their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thine inner chamber , and having shut thy door , pray to thy Father who is in secret , and thy Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee . <EOV> <SOV> And in praying use not vain repetitions , as the Gentiles do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking . <EOV> <SOV> Be not therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him . <EOV> <SOV> After this manner therefore pray ye . Our Father who art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . <EOV> <SOV> Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so on earth . <EOV> <SOV> Give us this day our daily bread . <EOV> <SOV> And forgive us our debts , as we also have forgiven our debtors . <EOV> <SOV> And bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil ' one . ' <EOV> <SOV> For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . <EOV> <SOV> Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may be seen of men to fast . Verily I say unto you , They have received their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thy head , and wash thy face ; <EOV> <SOV> that thou be not seen of men to fast , but of thy Father who is in secret : and thy Father , who seeth in secret , shall recompense thee . <EOV> <SOV> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth , where moth and rust consume , and where thieves break through and steal : <EOV> <SOV> but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth consume , and where thieves do not break through nor steal : <EOV> <SOV> for where thy treasure is , there will thy heart be also . <EOV> <SOV> The lamp of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light . <EOV> <SOV> But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is the darkness ! <EOV> <SOV> No man can serve two masters ; for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I say unto you , be not anxious for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more than the food , and the body than the raiment ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold the birds of the heaven , that they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; and your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are not ye of much more value then they ? <EOV> <SOV> And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his life ? <EOV> <SOV> And why are ye anxious concerning raiment ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin : <EOV> <SOV> yet I say unto you , that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . <EOV> <SOV> But if God doth so clothe the grass of the field , which to - day is , and to - morrow is cast into the oven , ' shall he ' not much more ' clothe ' you , O ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> Be not therefore anxious , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , Wherewithal shall we be clothed ? <EOV> <SOV> For after all these things do the Gentiles seek ; for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things . <EOV> <SOV> But seek ye first his kingdom , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you . <EOV> <SOV> Be not therefore anxious for the morrow : for the morrow will be anxious for itself . Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Judge not , that ye be not judged . <EOV> <SOV> For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye ; and lo , the beam is in thine own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast your pearls before the swine , lest haply they trample them under their feet , and turn and rend you . <EOV> <SOV> Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you : <EOV> <SOV> for every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> Or what man is there of you , who , if his son shall ask him for a loaf , will give him a stone ; <EOV> <SOV> or if he shall ask for a fish , will give him a serpent ? <EOV> <SOV> If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ? <EOV> <SOV> All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you , even so do ye also unto them : for this is the law and the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Enter ye in by the narrow gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many are they that enter in thereby . <EOV> <SOV> For narrow is the gate , and straitened the way , that leadeth unto life , and few are they that find it . <EOV> <SOV> Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly are ravening wolves . <EOV> <SOV> By their fruits ye shall know them . Do ' men ' gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ? <EOV> <SOV> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit . <EOV> <SOV> A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . <EOV> <SOV> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them . <EOV> <SOV> Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , did we not prophesy by thy name , and by thy name cast out demons , and by thy name do many mighty works ? <EOV> <SOV> And then will I profess unto them , I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> Every one therefore that heareth these words of mine , and doeth them , shall be likened unto a wise man , who built his house upon the rock : <EOV> <SOV> and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and if fell not : for it was founded upon the rock . <EOV> <SOV> And every one that heareth these words of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand : <EOV> <SOV> and the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and smote upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall thereof . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these words , the multitudes were astonished at his teaching : <EOV> <SOV> for he taught them as ' one ' having authority , and not as their scribes . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there came to him a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And he stretched forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou made clean . And straightway his leprosy was cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go , show thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , Lord , my servant lieth in the house sick of the palsy , grievously tormented . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto him , I will come and heal him . <EOV> <SOV> And the centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof ; but only say the word , and my servant shall be healed . <EOV> <SOV> For I also am a man under authority , having under myself soldiers : and I say to this one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , that many shall come from the east and the west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven : <EOV> <SOV> but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; as thou hast believed , ' so ' be it done unto thee . And the servant was healed in that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying sick of a fever . <EOV> <SOV> And he touched her hand , and the fever left her ; and she arose , and ministered unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And when even was come , they brought unto him many possessed with demons : and he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all that were sick : <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying : Himself took our infirmities , and bare our diseases . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandments to depart unto the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a scribe , and said unto him , Teacher , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the heaven ' have ' nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . <EOV> <SOV> And another of the disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus saith unto him , Follow me ; and leave the dead to bury their own dead . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was entered into a boat , his disciples followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves : but he was asleep . <EOV> <SOV> And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Save , Lord ; we perish . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm . <EOV> <SOV> And the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes , there met him two possessed with demons , coming forth out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man could pass by that way . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ? <EOV> <SOV> Now there was afar off from them a herd of many swine feeding . <EOV> <SOV> And the demons besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , send us away into the herd of swine . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Go . And they came out , and went into the swine : and behold , the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea , and perished in the waters . <EOV> <SOV> And they that fed them fled , and went away into the city , and told everything , and what was befallen to them that were possessed with demons . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , all the city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought ' him ' that he would depart from their borders . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered into a boat , and crossed over , and came into his own city . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins are forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> For which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven ; or to say , Arise , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive sins ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy ) , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go up unto thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and departed to his house . <EOV> <SOV> But when the multitudes saw it , they were afraid , and glorified God , who had given such authority unto men . <EOV> <SOV> And as Jesus passed by from thence , he saw a man , called Matthew , sitting at the place of toll : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as he sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> But when he heard it , he said , They that are whole have no need of a physician , but they that are sick . <EOV> <SOV> But go ye and learn what ' this ' meaneth , I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Then come to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then will they fast . <EOV> <SOV> And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment ; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment , and a worse rent is made . <EOV> <SOV> Neither do ' men ' put new wine into old wine - skins : else the skins burst , and the wine is spilled , and the skins perish : but they put new wine into fresh wine - skins , and both are preserved . <EOV> <SOV> While he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a ruler , and worshipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus arose , and followed him , and ' so did ' his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a woman , who had an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : <EOV> <SOV> for she said within herself , If I do but touch his garment , I shall be made whole . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus turning and seeing her said , Daughter , be of good cheer ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the flute - players , and the crowd making a tumult , <EOV> <SOV> he said , Give place : for the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn . <EOV> <SOV> But when the crowd was put forth , he entered in , and took her by the hand ; and the damsel arose . <EOV> <SOV> And the fame hereof went forth into all that land . <EOV> <SOV> And as Jesus passed by from thence , two blind men followed him , crying out , and saying , Have mercy on us , thou son of David . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They say unto him , Yea , Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it done unto you . <EOV> <SOV> And their eyes were opened . And Jesus strictly charged them , saying , See that no man know it . <EOV> <SOV> But they went forth , and spread abroad his fame in all that land . <EOV> <SOV> And as they went forth , behold , there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon . <EOV> <SOV> And when the demon was cast out , the dumb man spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees said , By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion for them , because they were distressed and scattered , as sheep not having a shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he unto his disciples , The harvest indeed is plenteous , but the laborers are few . <EOV> <SOV> Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he send forth laborers into his harvest . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he called unto him his twelve disciples , and gave them authority over unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness . <EOV> <SOV> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these : The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the ' son ' of Zebedee , and John his brother ; <EOV> <SOV> Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the publican ; James the ' son ' of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon the Cananaean , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him . <EOV> <SOV> These twelve Jesus sent forth , and charged them , saying , Go not into ' any ' way of the Gentiles , and enter not into any city of the Samaritans : <EOV> <SOV> but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> Heal the sick , raise the dead , cleanse the lepers , cast out demons : freely ye received , freely give . <EOV> <SOV> Get you no gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ; <EOV> <SOV> no wallet for ' your ' journey , neither two coats , nor shoes , nor staff : for the laborer is worthy of his food . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter , search out who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go forth . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye enter into the house , salute it . <EOV> <SOV> And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , as ye go forth out of that house or that city , shake off the dust of your feet . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment , than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves . <EOV> <SOV> But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to councils , and in theirs synagogues they will scourge you ; <EOV> <SOV> yea and before governors and kings shall ye be brought for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles . <EOV> <SOV> But when they deliver you up , be not anxious how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that hour what ye shall speak . <EOV> <SOV> For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh in you . <EOV> <SOV> And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and the father his child : and children shall rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> But when they persecute you in this city , flee into the next : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone through the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come . <EOV> <SOV> A disciple is not above his teacher , nor a servant above his lord . <EOV> <SOV> It is enough for the disciple that he be as his teacher , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more them of his household ! <EOV> <SOV> Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known . <EOV> <SOV> What I tell you in the darkness , speak ye in the light ; and what ye hear in the ear , proclaim upon the house - tops . <EOV> <SOV> And be not afraid of them that kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell . <EOV> <SOV> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny ? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father : <EOV> <SOV> but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . <EOV> <SOV> Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> Every one therefore who shall confess me before men , him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Think not that I came to send peace on the earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword . <EOV> <SOV> For I came to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law : <EOV> <SOV> and a man 's foes ' shall be ' they of his own household . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me . <EOV> <SOV> And he that doth not take his cross and follow after me , is not worthy of me . <EOV> <SOV> He that findeth his life shall lose it ; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it . <EOV> <SOV> He that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet 's reward : and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man 's reward . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only , in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities . <EOV> <SOV> Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ , he sent by his disciples <EOV> <SOV> and said unto him , Art thou he that cometh , or look we for another ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto them , Go and tell John the things which ye hear and see : <EOV> <SOV> the blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , and the dead are raised up , and the poor have good tidings preached to them . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed is he , whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me . <EOV> <SOV> And as these went their way , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to behold ? a reed shaken with the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? a man clothed in soft ' raiment ' ? Behold , they that wear soft ' raiment ' are in king 's houses . <EOV> <SOV> But wherefore went ye out ? to see a prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> This is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , Who shall prepare thy way before thee . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist : yet he that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and men of violence take it by force . <EOV> <SOV> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye are willing to receive ' it , ' this is Elijah , that is to come . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the marketplaces , who call unto their fellows <EOV> <SOV> and say , We piped unto you , and ye did not dance ; we wailed , and ye did not mourn . <EOV> <SOV> For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a demon . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold , a gluttonous man and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners ! And wisdom is justified by her works . <EOV> <SOV> Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , Capernaum , shalt thou be exalted unto heaven ? thou shalt go down unto Hades : for if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which were done in thee , it would have remained until this day . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee . <EOV> <SOV> At that season Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding , and didst reveal them unto babes : <EOV> <SOV> yea , Father , for so it was well - pleasing in thy sight . <EOV> <SOV> All things have been delivered unto me of my Father : and no one knoweth the Son , save the Father ; neither doth any know the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son willeth to reveal ' him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Come unto me , all ye that labor and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . <EOV> <SOV> Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls . <EOV> <SOV> For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that season Jesus went on the sabbath day through the grainfields ; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees , when they saw it , said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto them , Have ye not read what David did , when he was hungry , and they that were with him ; <EOV> <SOV> how he entered into the house of God , and ate the showbread , which it was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them that were with him , but only for the priests ? <EOV> <SOV> Or have ye not read in the law , that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are guiltless ? <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , that one greater than the temple is here . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye had known what this meaneth , I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is lord of the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And he departed thence , and went into their synagogue : <EOV> <SOV> and behold , a man having a withered hand . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ? that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , What man shall there be of you , that shall have one sheep , and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ? <EOV> <SOV> How much then is a man of more value than a sheep ! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , as the other . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees went out , and took counsel against him , how they might destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus perceiving ' it ' withdrew from thence : and many followed him ; and he healed them all , <EOV> <SOV> and charged them that they should not make him known : <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Behold , my servant whom I have chosen ; My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit upon him , And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles . <EOV> <SOV> He shall not strive , nor cry aloud ; Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets . <EOV> <SOV> A bruised reed shall he not break , And smoking flax shall he not quench , Till he send forth judgment unto victory . <EOV> <SOV> And in his name shall the Gentiles hope . <EOV> <SOV> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon , blind and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the dumb man spake and saw . <EOV> <SOV> And all the multitudes were amazed , and said , Can this be the son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This man doth not cast out demons , but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons . <EOV> <SOV> And knowing their thoughts he said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand : <EOV> <SOV> and if Satan casteth out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom stand ? <EOV> <SOV> And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then is the kingdom of God come upon you . <EOV> <SOV> Or how can one enter into the house of the strong ' man , ' and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong ' man ' ? and then he will spoil his house . <EOV> <SOV> He that is not with me is against me , and he that gathereth not with me scattereth . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I say unto you , Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men ; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him ; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , nor in that which is to come . <EOV> <SOV> Either make the tree good , and its fruit good ; or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by its fruit . <EOV> <SOV> Ye offspring of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things : and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment . <EOV> <SOV> For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned . <EOV> <SOV> Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him , saying , Teacher , we would see a sign from thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet : <EOV> <SOV> for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth . <EOV> <SOV> The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , a greater than Jonah is here . <EOV> <SOV> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , a greater than Solomon is here . <EOV> <SOV> But the unclean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passeth through waterless places , seeking rest , and findeth it not . <EOV> <SOV> Then he saith , I will return into my house whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished . <EOV> <SOV> Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking to the multitudes , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , seeking to speak to him . <EOV> <SOV> And one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , seeking to speak to thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ? <EOV> <SOV> And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples , and said , Behold , my mother and my brethren ! <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven , he is my brother , and sister , and mother . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> On that day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side . <EOV> <SOV> And there were gathered unto him great multitudes , so that he entered into a boat , and sat ; and all the multitude stood on the beach . <EOV> <SOV> And he spake to them many things in parables , saying , Behold , the sower went forth to sow ; <EOV> <SOV> and as he sowed , some ' seeds ' fell by the way side , and the birds came and devoured them : <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the rocky places , where they had not much earth : and straightway they sprang up , because they had no deepness of earth : <EOV> <SOV> and when the sun was risen , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away . <EOV> <SOV> And others fell upon the thorns ; and the thorns grew up and choked them : <EOV> <SOV> and others fell upon the good ground , and yielded fruit , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath ears , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples came , and said unto him , Why speakest thou unto them in parables ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore speak I to them in parables ; because seeing they see not , and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand . <EOV> <SOV> And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall in no wise understand ; And seeing ye shall see , and shall in no wise perceive : <EOV> <SOV> For this people 's heart is waxed gross , And their ears are dull of hearing , And their eyes they have closed ; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes , And hear with their ears , And understand with their heart , And should turn again , And I should heal them . <EOV> <SOV> But blessed are your eyes , for they see ; and your ears , for they hear . <EOV> <SOV> For verily I say unto you , that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see , and saw them not ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and heard them not . <EOV> <SOV> Hear then ye the parable of the sower . <EOV> <SOV> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , ' then ' cometh the evil ' one ' , and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart . This is he that was sown by the way side . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was sown upon the rocky places , this is he that heareth the word , and straightway with joy receiveth it ; <EOV> <SOV> yet hath he not root in himself , but endureth for a while ; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , straightway he stumbleth . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was sown among the thorns , this is he that heareth the word ; and the care of the world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> And he that was sown upon the good ground , this is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; who verily beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some a hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field : <EOV> <SOV> but while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat , and went away . <EOV> <SOV> But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also . <EOV> <SOV> And the servants of the householder came and said unto him , Sir , didst thou not sow good seed in thy field ? whence then hath it tares ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , An enemy hath done this . And the servants say unto him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ? <EOV> <SOV> But he saith , Nay ; lest haply while ye gather up the tares , ye root up the wheat with them . <EOV> <SOV> Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather up first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them ; but gather the wheat into my barn . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable set he before them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field : <EOV> <SOV> which indeed is less than all seeds ; but when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till it was all leavened . <EOV> <SOV> All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes ; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them : <EOV> <SOV> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Then he left the multitudes , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ; <EOV> <SOV> and the field is the world ; and the good seed , these are the sons of the kingdom ; and the tares are the sons of the evil ' one ' ; <EOV> <SOV> and the enemy that sowed them is the devil : and the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are angels . <EOV> <SOV> As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire ; so shall it be in the end of the world . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling , and them that do iniquity , <EOV> <SOV> and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . He that hath ears , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field ; which a man found , and hid ; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls : <EOV> <SOV> and having found one pearl of great price , he went and sold all that he had , and bought it . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind : <EOV> <SOV> which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach ; and they sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but the bad they cast away . <EOV> <SOV> So shall it be in the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the righteous , <EOV> <SOV> and shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> Have ye understood all these things ? They say unto him , Yea . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto them , Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder , who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence . <EOV> <SOV> And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ? <EOV> <SOV> Is not this the carpenter 's son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren , James , and Joseph , and Simon , and Judas ? <EOV> <SOV> And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then hath this man all these things ? <EOV> <SOV> And they were offended in him . But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and in his own house . <EOV> <SOV> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> and said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore do these powers work in him . <EOV> <SOV> For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> For John said unto him , It is not lawful for thee to have her . <EOV> <SOV> And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> But when Herod 's birthday came , the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst , and pleased Herod . <EOV> <SOV> Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask . <EOV> <SOV> And she , being put forward by her mother , saith , Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And the king was grieved ; but for the sake of his oaths , and of them that sat at meat with him , he commanded it to be given ; <EOV> <SOV> and he sent and beheaded John in the prison . <EOV> <SOV> And his head was brought on a platter , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples came , and took up the corpse , and buried him ; and they went and told Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus heard ' it ' , he withdrew from thence in a boat , to a desert place apart : and when the multitudes heard ' thereof , ' they followed him on foot from the cities . <EOV> <SOV> And he came forth , and saw a great multitude , and he had compassion on them , and healed their sick . <EOV> <SOV> And when even was come , the disciples came to him , saying , The place is desert , and the time is already past ; send the multitudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said unto them , They have no need to go away ; give ye them to eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they say unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Bring them hither to me . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass ; and he took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , twelve baskets full . <EOV> <SOV> And they that did eat were about five thousand men , besides women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat , and to go before him unto the other side , till he should send the multitudes away . <EOV> <SOV> And after he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into the mountain apart to pray : and when even was come , he was there alone . <EOV> <SOV> But the boat was now in the midst of the sea , distressed by the waves ; for the wind was contrary . <EOV> <SOV> And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them , walking upon the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a ghost ; and they cried out for fear . <EOV> <SOV> But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answered him and said , Lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto the upon the waters . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Come . And Peter went down from the boat , and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw the wind , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried out , saying , Lord , save me . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and took hold of him , and saith unto him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ? <EOV> <SOV> And when they were gone up into the boat , the wind ceased . <EOV> <SOV> And they that were in the boat worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had crossed over , they came to the land , unto Gennesaret . <EOV> <SOV> And when the men of that place knew him , they sent into all that region round about , and brought unto him all that were sick , <EOV> <SOV> and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment : and as many as touched were made whole . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition ? <EOV> <SOV> For God said , Honor thy father and thy mother : and , He that speaketh evil of father or mother , let him die the death . <EOV> <SOV> But ye say , whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given ' to God ' ; <EOV> <SOV> he shall not honor his father . And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition . <EOV> <SOV> Ye hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying , <EOV> <SOV> This people honoreth me with their lips ; But their heart is far from me . <EOV> <SOV> But in vain do they worship me , Teaching ' as their ' doctrines the precepts of men . <EOV> <SOV> And he called to him the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand : <EOV> <SOV> Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man ; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth , this defileth the man . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , when they heard this saying ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not , shall be rooted up . <EOV> <SOV> Let them alone : they are blind guides . And if the blind guide the blind , both shall fall into a pit . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answered and said unto him , Declare unto us the parable . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Are ye also even yet without understanding ? <EOV> <SOV> Perceive ye not , that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ? <EOV> <SOV> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart ; and they defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , railings : <EOV> <SOV> these are the things which defile the man ; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went out thence , and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders , and cried , saying , Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou son of David ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> But she came and worshipped him , saying , Lord , help me . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children 's bread and cast it to the dogs . <EOV> <SOV> But she said , Yea , Lord : for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it done unto thee even as thou wilt . And her daughter was healed from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus departed thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there . <EOV> <SOV> And there came unto him great multitudes , having with them the lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and they cast them down at this feet ; and he healed them : <EOV> <SOV> insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb speaking , the maimed whole , and lame walking , and the blind seeing : and they glorified the God of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus called unto him his disciples , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat : and I would not send them away fasting , lest haply they faint on the way . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples say unto him , Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few small fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground ; <EOV> <SOV> and he took the seven loaves and the fishes ; and he gave thanks and brake , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multitudes . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate , and were filled : and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces , seven baskets full . <EOV> <SOV> And they that did eat were four thousand men , besides women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent away the multitudes , and entered into the boat , and came into the borders of Magadan . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came , and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , ' It will be ' fair weather : for the heaven is red . <EOV> <SOV> And in the morning , ' It will be ' foul weather to - day : for the heaven is red and lowering . Ye know how to discern the face of the heaven ; but ye can not ' discern ' the signs of the times . <EOV> <SOV> An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of Jonah . And he left them , and departed . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned among themselves , saying , We took no bread . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus perceiving it said , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have no bread ? <EOV> <SOV> Do ye not yet perceive , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? <EOV> <SOV> Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? <EOV> <SOV> How is it that ye do not perceive that I spake not to you concerning bread ? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> Then understood they that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Who do men say that the Son of man is ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Some ' say ' John the Baptist ; some , Elijah ; and others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto them , But who say ye that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter answered and said , Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto him , Blessed art thou , Simon Bar - jonah : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And I also say unto thee , that thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it . <EOV> <SOV> I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Then charged he the disciples that they should tell no man that he was the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> From that time began Jesus to show unto his disciples , that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall never be unto thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art a stumbling - block unto me : for thou mindest not the things of God , but the things of men . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus unto his disciples , If any man would come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whosoever would save his life shall lose it : and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it . <EOV> <SOV> For what shall a man be profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his life ? <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then shall he render unto every man according to his deeds . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , there are some of them that stand here , who shall in no wise taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John his brother , and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart : <EOV> <SOV> and he was transfigured before them ; and his face did shine as the sun , and his garments became white as the light . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elijah talking with him . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answered , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , I will make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold , a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus came and touched them and said , Arise , and be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And lifting up their eyes , they saw no one , save Jesus only . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the scribes that Elijah must first come ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , Elijah indeed cometh , and shall restore all things : <EOV> <SOV> but I say into you , that Elijah is come already , and they knew him not , but did unto him whatsoever they would . Even so shall the Son of man also suffer of them . <EOV> <SOV> Then understood the disciples that he spake unto them of John the Baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a man , kneeling to him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Lord , have mercy on my son : for he is epileptic , and suffereth grievously ; for oft - times he falleth into the fire , and off - times into the water . <EOV> <SOV> And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I bear with you ? bring him hither to me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him ; and the demon went out of him : and the boy was cured from that hour . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast it out ? <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Because of your little faith : for verily I say unto you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you . <EOV> <SOV> ' But this kind goeth not out save by prayer and fasting . ' <EOV> <SOV> And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men ; <EOV> <SOV> and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised up . And they were exceeding sorry . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were come to Capernaum , they that received the half - shekel came to Peter , and said , Doth not your teacher pay the half - shekel ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith , Yea . And when he came into the house , Jesus spake first to him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? the kings of the earth , from whom do they receive toll or tribute ? from their sons , or from strangers ? <EOV> <SOV> And when he said , From strangers , Jesus said unto him , Therefore the sons are free . <EOV> <SOV> But , lest we cause them to stumble , go thou to the sea , and cast a hook , and take up the fish that first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a shekel : that take , and give unto them for me and thee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus , saying , Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? <EOV> <SOV> And he called to him a little child , and set him in the midst of them , <EOV> <SOV> and said , Verily I say unto you , Except ye turn , and become as little children , ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me : <EOV> <SOV> But whoso shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble , it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck , and ' that ' he should be sunk in the depth of the sea . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling ! for it must needs be that the occasions come ; but woe to that man through whom the occasion cometh ! <EOV> <SOV> And if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to stumble , cut it off , and cast it from thee : it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or halt , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire . <EOV> <SOV> And if thine eye causeth thee to stumble , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire . <EOV> <SOV> See that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> ' For the Son of man came to save that which was lost . ' <EOV> <SOV> How think ye ? if any man have a hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and go unto the mountains , and seek that which goeth astray ? <EOV> <SOV> And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray . <EOV> <SOV> Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy brother sin against thee , go , show him his fault between thee and him alone : if he hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother . <EOV> <SOV> But if he hear ' thee ' not , take with thee one or two more , that at the mouth of two witnesses or three every word may be established . <EOV> <SOV> And if he refuse to hear them , tell it unto the church : and if he refuse to hear the church also , let him be unto thee as the Gentile and the publican . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Again I say unto you , that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them . <EOV> <SOV> Then came Peter and said to him , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? until seven times ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times ; but , Until seventy times seven . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , who would make a reckoning with his servants . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , that owed him ten thousand talents . <EOV> <SOV> But forasmuch as he had not ' wherewith ' to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made . <EOV> <SOV> The servant therefore fell down and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all . <EOV> <SOV> And the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and forgave him the debt . <EOV> <SOV> But that servant went out , and found one of his fellow - servants , who owed him a hundred shillings : and he laid hold on him , and took ' him ' by the throat , saying , Pay what thou owest . <EOV> <SOV> So his fellow - servant fell down and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee . <EOV> <SOV> And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay that which was due . <EOV> <SOV> So when his fellow - servants saw what was done , they were exceeding sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done . <EOV> <SOV> Then his lord called him unto him , and saith to him , Thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou besoughtest me : <EOV> <SOV> shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow - servant , even as I had mercy on thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due . <EOV> <SOV> So shall also my heavenly Father do unto you , if ye forgive not every one his brother from your hearts . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words , he departed from Galilee , and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan ; <EOV> <SOV> and great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there . <EOV> <SOV> And there came unto him Pharisees , trying him , and saying , Is it lawful ' for a man ' to put away his wife for every cause ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , Have ye not read , that he who made ' them ' from the beginning made them male and female , <EOV> <SOV> and said , For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife ; and the two shall become one flesh ? <EOV> <SOV> So that they are no more two , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . <EOV> <SOV> They say unto him , Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement , and to put ' her ' away ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto them , Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it hath not been so . <EOV> <SOV> And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> The disciples say unto him , If the case of the man is so with his wife , it is not expedient to marry . <EOV> <SOV> But he said unto them , Not all men can receive this saying , but they to whom it is given . <EOV> <SOV> For there are eunuchs , that were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are eunuchs , that were made eunuchs by men : and there are eunuchs , that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . He that is able to receive it , let him receive it . <EOV> <SOV> Then were there brought unto him little children , that he should lay his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Suffer the little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , one came to him and said , Teacher , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Why askest thou me concerning that which is good ? One there is who is good : but if thou wouldest enter into life , keep the commandments . <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto him , Which ? And Jesus said , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness , <EOV> <SOV> Honor thy father and mother ; and , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> The young man saith unto him , All these things have I observed : what lack I yet ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto him , If thou wouldest be perfect , go , sell that which thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me . <EOV> <SOV> But when the young man heard the saying , he went away sorrowful ; for he was one that had great possessions . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples heard it , they were astonished exceedingly , saying , Who then can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus looking upon ' them ' said to them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered Peter and said unto him , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee ; what then shall we have ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto them , Verily I say unto you , that ye who have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And every one that hath left houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive a hundredfold , and shall inherit eternal life . <EOV> <SOV> But many shall be last ' that are ' first ; and first ' that are ' last . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that was a householder , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had agreed with the laborers for a shilling a day , he sent them into his vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing in the marketplace idle ; <EOV> <SOV> and to them he said , Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you . And they went their way . <EOV> <SOV> Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour , and did likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And about the eleventh ' hour ' he went out , and found others standing ; and he saith unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ? <EOV> <SOV> They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the laborers , and pay them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came that ' were hired ' about the eleventh hour , they received every man a shilling . <EOV> <SOV> And when the first came , they supposed that they would receive more ; and they likewise received every man a shilling . <EOV> <SOV> And when they received it , they murmured against the householder , <EOV> <SOV> saying , These last have spent ' but ' one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said to one of them , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a shilling ? <EOV> <SOV> Take up that which is thine , and go thy way ; it is my will to give unto this last , even as unto thee . <EOV> <SOV> Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? or is thine eye evil , because I am good ? <EOV> <SOV> So the last shall be first , and the first last . <EOV> <SOV> And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples apart , and on the way he said unto them , <EOV> <SOV> Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , <EOV> <SOV> and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify : and the third day he shall be raised up . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons , worshipping ' him ' , and asking a certain thing of him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto her , What wouldest thou ? She saith unto him , Command that these my two sons may sit , one on thy right hand , and one on thy left hand , in thy kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink ? They say unto him , We are able . <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto them , My cup indeed ye shall drink : but to sit on my right hand , and on ' my ' left hand , is not mine to give ; but ' it is for them ' for whom it hath been prepared of my Father . <EOV> <SOV> And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation concerning the two brethren . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them . <EOV> <SOV> Not so shall it be among you : but whosoever would become great among you shall be your minister ; <EOV> <SOV> and whosoever would be first among you shall be your servant : <EOV> <SOV> even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . <EOV> <SOV> And as they went out from Jericho , a great multitude followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , saying , Lord , have mercy on us , thou son of David . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude rebuked them , that they should hold their peace : but they cried out the more , saying , Lord , have mercy on us , thou son of David . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I should do unto you ? <EOV> <SOV> They say unto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , being moved with compassion , touched their eyes ; and straightway they received their sight , and followed him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem , and came unto Bethphage , unto the mount of Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying unto them , Go into the village that is over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose ' them ' , and bring ' them ' unto me . <EOV> <SOV> And if any one say aught unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them . <EOV> <SOV> Now this is come to pass , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Tell ye the daughter of Zion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , Meek , and riding upon an ass , And upon a colt the foal of an ass . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples went , and did even as Jesus appointed them , <EOV> <SOV> and brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their garments ; and he sat thereon . <EOV> <SOV> And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way ; and others cut branches from the trees , and spread them in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes that went before him , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the son of David : Blessed ' is ' he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come into Jerusalem , all the city was stirred , saying , Who is this ? <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes said , This is the prophet , Jesus , from Nazareth of Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus entered into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of he money - changers , and the seats of them that sold the doves ; <EOV> <SOV> and he saith unto them , It is written , My house shall be called a house of prayer : but ye make it a den of robbers . <EOV> <SOV> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them . <EOV> <SOV> But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children that were crying in the temple and saying , Hosanna to the son of David ; they were moved with indignation , <EOV> <SOV> and said unto him , Hearest thou what these are saying ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea : did ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise ? <EOV> <SOV> And he left them , and went forth out of the city to Bethany , and lodged there . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the morning as he returned to the city , he hungered . <EOV> <SOV> And seeing a fig tree by the way side , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only ; and he saith unto it , Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever . And immediately the fig tree withered away . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How did the fig tree immediately wither away ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree , but even if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou taken up and cast into the sea , it shall be done . <EOV> <SOV> And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one question , which if ye tell me , I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven or from men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why then did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> But if we shall say , From men ; we fear the multitude ; for all hold John as a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered Jesus , and said , We know not . He also said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> But what think ye ? A man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to - day in the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented himself , and went . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I ' go ' , sir : and went not . <EOV> <SOV> Which of the two did the will of his father ? They say , The first . Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you . <EOV> <SOV> For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not ; but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye saw it , did not even repent yourselves afterward , that ye might believe him . <EOV> <SOV> Hear another parable : There was a man that was a householder , who planted a vineyard , and set a hedge about it , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into another country . <EOV> <SOV> And when the season of the fruits drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , to receive his fruits . <EOV> <SOV> And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another . <EOV> <SOV> Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> But afterward he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son . <EOV> <SOV> But the husbandmen , when they saw the son , said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and take his inheritance . <EOV> <SOV> And they took him , and cast him forth out of the vineyard , and killed him . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come , what will he do unto those husbandmen ? <EOV> <SOV> They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those miserable men , and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen , who shall render him the fruits in their seasons . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , The same was made the head of the corner ; This was from the Lord , And it is marvelous in our eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken away from you , and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof . <EOV> <SOV> And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will scatter him as dust . <EOV> <SOV> And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them . <EOV> <SOV> And when they sought to lay hold on him , they feared the multitudes , because they took him for a prophet . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king , who made a marriage feast for his son , <EOV> <SOV> and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast : and they would not come . <EOV> <SOV> Again he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them that are bidden , Behold , I have made ready my dinner ; my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come to the marriage feast . <EOV> <SOV> But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his own farm , another to his merchandise ; <EOV> <SOV> and the rest laid hold on his servants , and treated them shamefully , and killed them . <EOV> <SOV> But the king was wroth ; and he sent his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned their city . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they that were bidden were not worthy . <EOV> <SOV> Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage feast . <EOV> <SOV> And those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was filled with guests . <EOV> <SOV> But when the king came in to behold the guests , he saw there a man who had not on a wedding - garment : <EOV> <SOV> and he saith unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding - garment ? And he was speechless . <EOV> <SOV> Then the king said to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and cast him out into the outer darkness ; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> For many are called , but few chosen . <EOV> <SOV> Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might ensnare him in ' his ' talk . <EOV> <SOV> And they send to him their disciples , with the Herodians , saying , Teacher , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , and carest not for any one : for thou regardest not the person of men . <EOV> <SOV> Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why make ye trial of me , ye hypocrites ? <EOV> <SOV> Show me the tribute money . And they brought unto him a denarius . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? <EOV> <SOV> They say unto him , Caesar 's . Then saith he unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar 's ; and unto God the things that are God 's . <EOV> <SOV> And when they heard it , they marvelled , and left him , and went away . <EOV> <SOV> On that day there came to him Sadducees , they that say that there is no resurrection : and they asked him , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Teacher , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first married and deceased , and having no seed left his wife unto his brother ; <EOV> <SOV> in like manner the second also , and the third , unto the seventh . <EOV> <SOV> And after them all , the woman died . <EOV> <SOV> In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as angels in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying , <EOV> <SOV> I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not ' the God ' of the dead , but of the living . <EOV> <SOV> And when the multitudes heard it , they were astonished at his teaching . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees , when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , gathered themselves together . <EOV> <SOV> And one of them , a lawyer , asked him a question , trying him : <EOV> <SOV> Teacher , which is the great commandment in the law ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind . <EOV> <SOV> This is the great and first commandment . <EOV> <SOV> And a second like ' unto it ' is this , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> On these two commandments the whole law hangeth , and the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them a question , <EOV> <SOV> saying , What think ye of the Christ ? whose son is he ? They say unto him , ' The son ' of David . <EOV> <SOV> He saith unto them , How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet ? <EOV> <SOV> If David then calleth him Lord , how is he his son ? <EOV> <SOV> And no one was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then spake Jesus to the multitudes and to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> saying , The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses seat : <EOV> <SOV> all things therefore whatsoever they bid you , ' these ' do and observe : but do not ye after their works ; for they say , and do not . <EOV> <SOV> Yea , they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with their finger . <EOV> <SOV> But all their works they do to be seen of men : for they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders ' of their garments ' , <EOV> <SOV> and love the chief place at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues , <EOV> <SOV> and the salutations in the marketplaces , and to be called of men , Rabbi . <EOV> <SOV> But be not ye called Rabbi : for one is your teacher , and all ye are brethren . <EOV> <SOV> And call no man your father on the earth : for one is your Father , ' even ' he who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Neither be ye called masters : for one is your master , ' even ' the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant . <EOV> <SOV> And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled ; and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye shut the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye enter not in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , even while for a pretence ye make long prayers : therefore ye shall receive greater condemnation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte ; and when he is become so , ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , ye blind guides , that say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor . <EOV> <SOV> Ye fools and blind : for which is greater , the gold , or the temple that hath sanctified the gold ? <EOV> <SOV> And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it , he is a debtor . <EOV> <SOV> Ye blind : for which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ? <EOV> <SOV> He therefore that sweareth by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon . <EOV> <SOV> And he that sweareth by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein . <EOV> <SOV> And he that sweareth by the heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye tithe mint and anise and cummin , and have left undone the weightier matters of the law , justice , and mercy , and faith : but these ye ought to have done , and not to have left the other undone . <EOV> <SOV> Ye blind guides , that strain out the gnat , and swallow the camel ! <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full from extortion and excess . <EOV> <SOV> Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter , that the outside thereof may become clean also . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which outwardly appear beautiful , but inwardly are full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness . <EOV> <SOV> Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and garnish the tombs of the righteous , <EOV> <SOV> and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we should not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore ye witness to yourselves , that ye are sons of them that slew the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers . <EOV> <SOV> Ye serpents , ye offspring of vipers , how shall ye escape the judgment of hell ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : some of them shall ye kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute from city to city : <EOV> <SOV> that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth , from the blood of Abel the righteous unto the blood of Zachariah son of Barachiah , whom ye slew between the sanctuary and the altar . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation . <EOV> <SOV> O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that killeth the prophets , and stoneth them that are sent unto her ! how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not ! <EOV> <SOV> Behold , your house is left unto you desolate . <EOV> <SOV> For I say unto you , Ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , Blessed ' is ' he that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way ; and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And as he sat on the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what ' shall be ' the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said unto them , Take heed that no man lead you astray . <EOV> <SOV> For many shall come in my name , saying , I am the Christ ; and shall lead many astray . <EOV> <SOV> And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars ; see that ye be not troubled : for ' these things ' must needs come to pass ; but the end is not yet . <EOV> <SOV> For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom ; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places . <EOV> <SOV> But all these things are the beginning of travail . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall they deliver you up unto tribulation , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all the nations for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> And then shall many stumble , and shall deliver up one another , and shall hate one another . <EOV> <SOV> And many false prophets shall arise , and shall lead many astray . <EOV> <SOV> And because iniquity shall be multiplied , the love of the many shall wax cold . <EOV> <SOV> But he that endureth to the end , the same shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations ; and then shall the end come . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore ye see the abomination of desolation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let him that readeth understand ) , <EOV> <SOV> then let them that are in Judaea flee unto the mountains : <EOV> <SOV> let him that is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house : <EOV> <SOV> and let him that is in the field not return back to take his cloak . <EOV> <SOV> But woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days ! <EOV> <SOV> And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on a sabbath : <EOV> <SOV> for then shall be great tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now , no , nor ever shall be . <EOV> <SOV> And except those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved : but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shortened . <EOV> <SOV> Then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is the Christ , or , Here ; believe ' it ' not . <EOV> <SOV> For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall show great signs and wonders ; so as to lead astray , if possible , even the elect . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I have told you beforehand . <EOV> <SOV> If therefore they shall say unto you , Behold , he is in the wilderness ; go not forth : Behold , he is in the inner chambers ; believe ' it ' not . <EOV> <SOV> For as the lightning cometh forth from the east , and is seen even unto the west ; so shall be the coming of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together . <EOV> <SOV> But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken : <EOV> <SOV> and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> And he shall send forth his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other . <EOV> <SOV> Now from the fig tree learn her parable : when her branch is now become tender , and putteth forth its leaves , ye know that the summer is nigh ; <EOV> <SOV> even so ye also , when ye see all these things , know ye that he is nigh , ' even ' at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all these things be accomplished . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But of that day and hour knoweth no one , not even the angels of heaven , neither the Son , but the Father only . <EOV> <SOV> And as ' were ' the days of Noah , so shall be the coming of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , <EOV> <SOV> and they knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall be the coming of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall two man be in the field ; one is taken , and one is left : <EOV> <SOV> two women ' shall be ' grinding at the mill ; one is taken , and one is left . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore : for ye know not on what day your Lord cometh . <EOV> <SOV> But know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken through . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore be ye also ready ; for in an hour that ye think not the Son of man cometh . <EOV> <SOV> Who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath set over his household , to give them their food in due season ? <EOV> <SOV> Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , that he will set him over all that he hath . <EOV> <SOV> But if that evil servant shall say in his heart , My lord tarrieth ; <EOV> <SOV> and shall begin to beat his fellow - servants , and shall eat and drink with the drunken ; <EOV> <SOV> the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he expecteth not , and in an hour when he knoweth not , <EOV> <SOV> and shall cut him asunder , and appoint his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom . <EOV> <SOV> And five of them were foolish , and five were wise . <EOV> <SOV> For the foolish , when they took their lamps , took no oil with them : <EOV> <SOV> but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps . <EOV> <SOV> Now while the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept . <EOV> <SOV> But at midnight there is a cry , Behold , the bridegroom ! Come ye forth to meet him . <EOV> <SOV> Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps . <EOV> <SOV> And the foolish said unto the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are going out . <EOV> <SOV> But the wise answered , saying , Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you : go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> And while they went away to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast : and the door was shut . <EOV> <SOV> Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , Verily I say unto you , I know you not . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore , for ye know not the day nor the hour . <EOV> <SOV> For ' it is ' as ' when ' a man , going into another country , called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods . <EOV> <SOV> And unto one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his several ability ; and he went on his journey . <EOV> <SOV> Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them , and made other five talents . <EOV> <SOV> In like manner he also that ' received ' the two gained other two . <EOV> <SOV> But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money . <EOV> <SOV> Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and maketh a reckoning with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : lo , I have gained other five talents . <EOV> <SOV> His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things ; enter thou into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he also that ' received ' the two talents came and said , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : lo , I have gained other two talents . <EOV> <SOV> His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will set thee over many things ; enter thou into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> And he also that had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou didst not sow , and gathering where thou didst not scatter ; <EOV> <SOV> and I was afraid , and went away and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , thou hast thine own . <EOV> <SOV> But his lord answered and said unto him , Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I did not scatter ; <EOV> <SOV> thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers , and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest . <EOV> <SOV> Take ye away therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him that hath the ten talents . <EOV> <SOV> For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not , even that which he hath shall be taken away . <EOV> <SOV> And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness : there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the angels with him , then shall he sit on the throne of his glory : <EOV> <SOV> and before him shall be gathered all the nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats ; <EOV> <SOV> and he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world : <EOV> <SOV> for I was hungry , and ye gave me to eat ; I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink ; I was a stranger , and ye took me in ; <EOV> <SOV> naked , and ye clothed me ; I was sick , and ye visited me ; I was in prison , and ye came unto me . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungry , and fed thee ? or athirst , and gave thee drink ? <EOV> <SOV> And when saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren , ' even ' these least , ye did it unto me . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels : <EOV> <SOV> for I was hungry , and ye did not give me to eat ; I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink ; <EOV> <SOV> I was a stranger , and ye took me not in ; naked , and ye clothed me not ; sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall they also answer , saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungry , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least , ye did it not unto me . <EOV> <SOV> And these shall go away into eternal punishment : but the righteous into eternal life . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished all these words , he said unto his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Ye know that after two days the passover cometh , and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> Then were gathered together the chief priests , and the elders of the people , unto the court of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ; <EOV> <SOV> and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety , and kill him . <EOV> <SOV> But they said , Not during the feast , lest a tumult arise among people . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , <EOV> <SOV> there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment , and she poured it upon his head , as he sat at meat . <EOV> <SOV> But when the disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ? <EOV> <SOV> For this ' ointment ' might have been sold for much , and given to the poor . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus perceiving it said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me . <EOV> <SOV> For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> For in that she poured this ointment upon my body , she did it to prepare me for burial . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her . <EOV> <SOV> Then one of the twelve , who was called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests , <EOV> <SOV> and said , What are ye willing to give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver . <EOV> <SOV> And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him ' unto them . ' <EOV> <SOV> Now on the first ' day ' of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying , Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Teacher saith , My time is at hand ; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them ; and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> Now when even was come , he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples ; <EOV> <SOV> and as they were eating , he said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me . <EOV> <SOV> And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began to say unto him every one , Is it I , Lord ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , He that dipped his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man goeth , even as it is written of him : but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had not been born . <EOV> <SOV> And Judas , who betrayed him , answered and said , Is it I , Rabbi ? He saith unto him , Thou hast said . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it ; and he gave to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body . <EOV> <SOV> And he took a cup , and gave thanks , and gave to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ; <EOV> <SOV> for this is my blood of the covenant , which is poured out for many unto remission of sins . <EOV> <SOV> But I say unto you , I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father 's kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had sung a hymn , they went out unto the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended in me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> But after I am raised up , I will go before you into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter answered and said unto him , If all shall be offended in thee , I will never be offended . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , that this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith unto him , Even if I must die with thee , ' yet ' will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto his disciples , Sit ye here , while I go yonder and pray . <EOV> <SOV> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : abide ye here , and watch with me . <EOV> <SOV> And he went forward a little , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , My Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass away from me : nevertheless , not as I will , but as thou wilt . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ? <EOV> <SOV> Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . <EOV> <SOV> Again a second time he went away , and prayed , saying , My Father , if this can not pass away , except I drink it , thy will be done . <EOV> <SOV> And he came again and found them sleeping , for their eyes were heavy . <EOV> <SOV> And he left them again , and went away , and prayed a third time , saying again the same words . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh he to the disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Arise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that betrayeth me . <EOV> <SOV> And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priest and elders of the people . <EOV> <SOV> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that is he : take him . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , Rabbi ; and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said unto him , Friend , ' do ' that for which thou art come . Then they came and laid hands on Jesus , and took him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and smote the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into its place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword . <EOV> <SOV> Or thinkest thou that I can not beseech my Father , and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels ? <EOV> <SOV> How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be ? <EOV> <SOV> In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me ? I sat daily in the temple teaching , and ye took me not . <EOV> <SOV> But all this is come to pass , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples left him , and fled . <EOV> <SOV> And they that had taken Jesus led him away to ' the house of ' Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were gathered together . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter followed him afar off , unto the court of the high priest , and entered in , and sat with the officers , to see the end . <EOV> <SOV> Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus , that they might put him to death ; <EOV> <SOV> and they found it not , though many false witnesses came . But afterward came two , <EOV> <SOV> and said , This man said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest stood up , and said unto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ , the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power , and coming on the clouds of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Then the high priest rent his garments , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy : what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard the blasphemy : <EOV> <SOV> what think ye ? They answered and said , He is worthy of death . <EOV> <SOV> Then did they spit in his face and buffet him : and some smote him with the palms of their hands , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ : who is he that struck thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Now Peter was sitting without in the court : and a maid came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was gone out into the porch , another ' maid ' saw him , and saith unto them that were there , This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> And again he denied with an oath , I know not the man . <EOV> <SOV> And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter , Of a truth thou also art ' one ' of them ; for thy speech maketh thee known . <EOV> <SOV> Then began he to curse and to swear , I know not the man . And straightway the cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now when morning was come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death : <EOV> <SOV> and they bound him , and led him away , and delivered him up to Pilate the governor . <EOV> <SOV> Then Judas , who betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders , <EOV> <SOV> saying , I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood . But they said , What is that to us ? see thou ' to it ' . <EOV> <SOV> And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary , and departed ; and he went away and hanged himself . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests took the pieces of silver , and said , It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , since it is the price of blood . <EOV> <SOV> And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore that field was called , the field of blood , unto this day . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet , saying , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was priced , whom ' certain ' of the children of Israel did price ; <EOV> <SOV> and they gave them for the potter 's field , as the Lord appointed me . <EOV> <SOV> Now Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Pilate unto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And he gave him no answer , not even to one word : insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly . <EOV> <SOV> Now at the feast the governor was wo nt to release unto the multitude one prisoner , whom they would . <EOV> <SOV> And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas , or Jesus who is called Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was sitting on the judgment - seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man ; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him . <EOV> <SOV> Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas , and destroy Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But the governor answered and said unto them , Which of the two will ye that I release unto you ? And they said , Barabbas . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate saith unto them , What then shall I do unto Jesus who is called Christ ? They all say , Let him be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out exceedingly , saying , Let him be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing , but rather that a tumult was arising , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man ; see ye ' to it ' . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people answered and said , His blood ' be ' on us , and on our children . <EOV> <SOV> Then released he unto them Barabbas ; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium , and gathered unto him the whole band . <EOV> <SOV> And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe . <EOV> <SOV> And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand ; and they kneeled down before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews ! <EOV> <SOV> And they spat upon him , and took the reed and smote him on the head . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had mocked him , they took off from him the robe , and put on him his garments , and led him away to crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to go ' with them ' , that he might bear his cross . <EOV> <SOV> And they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , The place of a skull , <EOV> <SOV> they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted it , he would not drink . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments among them , casting lots ; <EOV> <SOV> and they sat and watched him there . <EOV> <SOV> And they set up over his head his accusation written , THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> Then are there crucified with him two robbers , one on the right hand and one on the left . <EOV> <SOV> And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , <EOV> <SOV> and saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself : if thou art the Son of God , come down from the cross . <EOV> <SOV> In like manner also the chief priests mocking ' him ' , with the scribes and elders , said , <EOV> <SOV> He saved others ; himself he can not save . He is the King of Israel ; let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe on him . <EOV> <SOV> He trusteth on God ; let him deliver him now , if he desireth him : for he said , I am the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And the robbers also that were crucified with him cast upon him the same reproach . <EOV> <SOV> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour . <EOV> <SOV> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? <EOV> <SOV> And some of them stood there , when they heard it , said , This man calleth Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> And straightway one of them ran , and took a sponge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink . <EOV> <SOV> And the rest said , Let be ; let us see whether Elijah cometh to save him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus cried again with a loud voice , and yielded up his spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake ; and the rocks were rent ; <EOV> <SOV> and the tombs were opened ; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised ; <EOV> <SOV> and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many . <EOV> <SOV> Now the centurion , and they that were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And many women were there beholding from afar , who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him : <EOV> <SOV> among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee . <EOV> <SOV> And when even was come , there came a rich man from Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple : <EOV> <SOV> this man went to Pilate , and asked for the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded it to be given up . <EOV> <SOV> And Joseph took the body , and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth , <EOV> <SOV> and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , and departed . <EOV> <SOV> And Mary Magdalene was there , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> Now on the morrow , which is ' the day ' after the Preparation , the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive , After three days I rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest haply his disciples come and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : and the last error will be worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate said unto them , Ye have a guard : go , make it ' as ' sure as ye can . <EOV> <SOV> So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , the guard being with them . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now late on the sabbath day , as it began to dawn toward the first ' day ' of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a great earthquake ; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled away the stone , and sat upon it . <EOV> <SOV> His appearance was as lightning , and his raiment white as snow : <EOV> <SOV> and for fear of him the watchers did quake , and became as dead men . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye ; for I know that ye seek Jesus , who hath been crucified . <EOV> <SOV> He is not here ; for he is risen , even as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay . <EOV> <SOV> And go quickly , and tell his disciples , He is risen from the dead ; and lo , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy , and ran to bring his disciples word . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . And they came and took hold of his feet , and worshipped him . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus unto them , Fear not : go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee , and there shall they see me . <EOV> <SOV> Now while they were going , behold , some of the guard came into the city , and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave much money unto the soldiers , <EOV> <SOV> saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept . <EOV> <SOV> And if this come to the governor 's ears , we will persuade him , and rid you of care . <EOV> <SOV> So they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews , ' and continueth ' until this day . <EOV> <SOV> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee , unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him , they worshipped ' him ' ; but some doubted . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus came to them and spake unto them , saying , All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth . <EOV> <SOV> Go ye therefore , and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit : <EOV> <SOV> teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you : and lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world . <EOV> <EOC>
