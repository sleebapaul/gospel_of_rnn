<SOC> <SOV> The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren ; <EOV> <SOV> And Judah begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ; <EOV> <SOV> And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ; <EOV> <SOV> And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ; <EOV> <SOV> And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah ; <EOV> <SOV> And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ; <EOV> <SOV> And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ; <EOV> <SOV> And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ; <EOV> <SOV> And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ; <EOV> <SOV> And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon : <EOV> <SOV> And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel ; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ; <EOV> <SOV> And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ; <EOV> <SOV> And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ; <EOV> <SOV> And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ; <EOV> <SOV> And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ . <EOV> <SOV> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations . <EOV> <SOV> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner : When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child by the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a public example , purposed to put her away privately . <EOV> <SOV> But while he thought on these things , the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins . <EOV> <SOV> Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us . <EOV> <SOV> Then Joseph , being raised from sleep , did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took to him his wife : <EOV> <SOV> And knew her not till she had brought forth her first - born son : and he called his name JESUS . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Now , after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Where is he that is born king of the Jews ? for we have seen his star in the east , and have come to worship him . <EOV> <SOV> When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people , he inquired of them where Christ should be born . <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , In Bethlehem of Judea : for thus it is written by the prophet , <EOV> <SOV> And thou Bethlehem , in the land of Judah , art not the least among the princes of Judah : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod , when he had privately called the wise men , inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go , and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also . <EOV> <SOV> When they had heard the king , they departed ; and lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was . <EOV> <SOV> When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshiped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented to him gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh . <EOV> <SOV> And being warned by God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had departed , behold , the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I bring thee word : for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> When he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt : <EOV> <SOV> And was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son . <EOV> <SOV> Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all its borders , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> In Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not . <EOV> <SOV> But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead who sought the young child 's life . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned by God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee : <EOV> <SOV> And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In those days came John the Baptist , preaching in the wilderness of Judea , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , Repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . <EOV> <SOV> And the same John had his raiment of camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his food was locusts and wild honey . <EOV> <SOV> Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judea , and all the region about Jordan , <EOV> <SOV> And were baptized by him in Jordan , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said to them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ? <EOV> <SOV> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance : <EOV> <SOV> And think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham for our father : for I say to you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham . <EOV> <SOV> And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> I indeed baptize you with water to repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit , and with fire : <EOV> <SOV> Whose fan is in his hand , and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor , and gather his wheat into the granary ; but he will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John , to be baptized by him . <EOV> <SOV> But John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized by thee , and comest thou to me ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness . Then he suffered him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , when he was baptized , went up immediately out of the water : and lo , the heavens were opened to him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him : <EOV> <SOV> And lo , a voice from heaven , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then was Jesus led by the Spirit into the wilderness , to be tempted by the devil . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward hungry . <EOV> <SOV> And when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou art the son of God , command that these stones be made bread . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God . <EOV> <SOV> Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple , <EOV> <SOV> And saith to him , If thou art the Son of God , cast thyself down , for it is written , He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall uphold thee , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , It is written again , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the devil taketh him up upon an exceeding high mountain , and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them , <EOV> <SOV> And saith to him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus to him , Be gone , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve . <EOV> <SOV> Then the devil leaveth him , and behold , angels came and ministered to him . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim ; <EOV> <SOV> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles : <EOV> <SOV> The people who sat in darkness , saw great light ; and to them who sat in the region and shades of death , light hath arisen . <EOV> <SOV> From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say , Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men . <EOV> <SOV> And they immediately left their nets , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a boat with Zebedee their father , mending their nets : and he called them . <EOV> <SOV> And they immediately left the boat , and their father , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness , and all manner of disease among the people . <EOV> <SOV> And his fame spread throughout all Syria : and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments , and those who were possessed with demons , and those who were lunatic , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee , and from Decapolis , and from Jerusalem , and from Judea , and from beyond Jordan . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And seeing the multitudes , he ascended a mountain : and when he was seated , his disciples came to him . <EOV> <SOV> And he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness : for they shall be filled . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are the peace - makers : for they shall be called children of God . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Blessed are ye when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake . <EOV> <SOV> Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt hath lost its savor , with what shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot by men . <EOV> <SOV> Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on a hill can not be hid . <EOV> <SOV> Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a close vessel , but on a candlestick : and it giveth light to all that are in the house . <EOV> <SOV> Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfill . <EOV> <SOV> For verily I say to you , Till heaven and earth shall pass away , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whoever shall do , and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whoever shall kill , shall be in danger of the judgment : <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause , shall be in danger of the judgment : and whoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell - fire . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore if thou shalt bring thy gift to the altar , and there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee ; <EOV> <SOV> Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift . <EOV> <SOV> Agree with thy adversary quickly , while thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , I say to thee , thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time , Thou shalt not commit adultery : <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , That whoever looketh on a woman to lust after her , hath committed adultery with her already in his heart . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy right eye shall cause thee to sin , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy right hand shall cause thee to sin , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell . <EOV> <SOV> It hath been said , Whoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement : <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , That whoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of lewdness , causeth her to commit adultery : and whoever shall marry her that is divorced , committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> Again , ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform to the Lord thy oaths : <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , Swear not at all : neither by heaven ; for it is God 's throne : <EOV> <SOV> Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King , <EOV> <SOV> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black . <EOV> <SOV> But let your communication be , Yea , yea , Nay , nay : for whatever is more than these cometh of evil . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it hath been said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , That ye resist not evil : but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloke also . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall constrain thee to go one mile , go with him two . <EOV> <SOV> Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee , turn not thou away . <EOV> <SOV> Ye have heard that it hath been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbor , and hate thy enemy : <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them who despitefully use you , and persecute you ; <EOV> <SOV> That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust . <EOV> <SOV> For if ye love them who love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ? <EOV> <SOV> And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ? <EOV> <SOV> Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen by them : otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore , when thou doest thy alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do , in the synagogues , and in the streets , that they may have glory from men . Verily , I say to you , they have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth : <EOV> <SOV> That thy alms may be in secret ; and thy Father who seeth in secret , himself will reward thee openly . <EOV> <SOV> And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues , and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen by men . Verily , I say to you , they have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father who is in secret , and thy Father who seeth in secret , will reward thee openly . <EOV> <SOV> But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore be ye not like them : for your Father knoweth what things ye need before ye ask him . <EOV> <SOV> After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father who art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . <EOV> <SOV> Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Give us this day our daily bread . <EOV> <SOV> And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors . <EOV> <SOV> And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil . For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen . <EOV> <SOV> For , if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you : <EOV> <SOV> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . <EOV> <SOV> Moreover , when ye fast , be not as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear to men to fast . Verily , I say to you , they have their reward . <EOV> <SOV> But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thy head , and wash thy face ; <EOV> <SOV> That thou mayest not appear to men to fast , but to thy Father , who is in secret : and thy Father , who seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly . <EOV> <SOV> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal : <EOV> <SOV> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal . <EOV> <SOV> For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also . <EOV> <SOV> The light of the body is the eye : if therefore thy eye be single , thy whole body will be full of light . <EOV> <SOV> But if thy eye be evil , thy whole body will be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness , how great is that darkness ! <EOV> <SOV> No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I say to you , Be not anxious for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more than food , and the body than raiment ? <EOV> <SOV> Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ? <EOV> <SOV> Which of you by anxious care can add one cubit to his stature ? <EOV> <SOV> And why are ye anxious for raiment ? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow ? they toil not , neither do they spin ? <EOV> <SOV> And yet I say to you , that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore , if God so clotheth the grass of the field , which to - day is , and to - morrow is cast into the oven , will he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore be not anxious , saying , What shall we eat ? or what shall we drink ? or , with what shall we be clothed ? <EOV> <SOV> ( For after all these things do the Gentiles seek ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things . <EOV> <SOV> But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added to you . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore be not anxious for the morrow : for the morrow will be solicitous for the things of itself . Sufficient to the day is its own evil . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Judge not , that ye be not judged . <EOV> <SOV> For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and the measure which ye give , shall be measured to you again . <EOV> <SOV> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thy eye ; and behold , a beam is in thy own eye ? <EOV> <SOV> Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thy own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye . <EOV> <SOV> Give not that which is holy to dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you . <EOV> <SOV> Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and the door shall be opened to you : <EOV> <SOV> For every one that asketh , receiveth ; and he that seeketh , findeth ; and to him that knocketh , the door shall be opened . <EOV> <SOV> Or what man is there of you , who , if his son shall ask bread , will give him a stone ? <EOV> <SOV> Or if he shall ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ? <EOV> <SOV> If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Enter ye in at the strait gate ; for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there are who go in by it . <EOV> <SOV> Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth to life , and few there are that find it . <EOV> <SOV> Beware of false prophets , who come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves . <EOV> <SOV> Ye shall know them by their fruits : Do men gather grapes from thorns , or figs from thistles : <EOV> <SOV> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit . <EOV> <SOV> A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit . <EOV> <SOV> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them , <EOV> <SOV> Not every one that saith to me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out demons ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ? <EOV> <SOV> And then will I profess to them , I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him to a wise man , who built his house upon a rock : <EOV> <SOV> And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock . <EOV> <SOV> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened to a foolish man , who built his house upon the sand : <EOV> <SOV> And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell , and great was the fall of it . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> For he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When he had come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there came a leper and worshiped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to him , See thou tell no man ; but go , show thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had entered into Capernaum , there came to him a centurion , beseeching him , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick with the palsy , grievously tormented . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to him , I will come and heal him . <EOV> <SOV> The centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant will be healed . <EOV> <SOV> For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus heard it , he marveled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say to you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , that many shall come from the east and the west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into utter darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to the centurion , Depart ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done to thee . And his servant was healed in the same hour . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus had come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and sick with a fever . <EOV> <SOV> And he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered to them . <EOV> <SOV> When the evening was come , they brought to him many that were possessed with demons : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick ; <EOV> <SOV> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , saying , He himself took our infirmities , and bore our sicknesses . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart to the other side . <EOV> <SOV> And a certain scribe came , and said to him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head . <EOV> <SOV> And another of his disciples said to him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had entered into a boat , his disciples followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves : but he was asleep . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm . <EOV> <SOV> But the men marveled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him ! <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come to the other side , into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with demons , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ? <EOV> <SOV> And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine , feeding . <EOV> <SOV> So the demons besought him , saying , If thou expellest us , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , Go . And when they had come out , they went into the herd of swine : and behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters . <EOV> <SOV> And they that kept them , fled , and went into the city , and told every thing ; and what had befallen to the possessed with demons . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their borders . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered into a boat , and passed over , and came into his own city . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , they brought to him a man sick with the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the sick of the palsy , Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins are forgiven thee . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , knowing their thoughts , said , Why think ye evil in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> For which is easier , to say , Thy sins are forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick with the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go to thy house . <EOV> <SOV> And he arose , and departed to his house . <EOV> <SOV> But when the multitude saw it , they marveled , and glorified God , who had given such power to men . <EOV> <SOV> And as Jesus was passing from thence , he saw a man named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith to him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at table in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And when the Pharisees saw it , they said to his disciples , Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners ? <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus heard that , he said to them , They that are in health need not a physician , but they that are sick . <EOV> <SOV> But go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast often , but thy disciples fast not ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Can the children of the bride - chamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then they will fast . <EOV> <SOV> No man putteth a piece of new cloth to an old garment : for that which is put in to fill it up , taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse . <EOV> <SOV> Neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles break , and the wine runneth out , and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bottles , and both are preserved . <EOV> <SOV> While he was speaking these things to them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshiped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she will live . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> ( And behold , a woman who was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment . <EOV> <SOV> For she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus turned himself about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that hour . ) <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise , <EOV> <SOV> He said to them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . And they derided him . <EOV> <SOV> But when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose . <EOV> <SOV> And the fame of this went abroad into all that land . <EOV> <SOV> And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou son of David , have mercy on us . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith to them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said to him , Yes , Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Then he touched their eyes , saying , According to your faith , be it to you . <EOV> <SOV> And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus strictly charged them , saying , See that no man know it . <EOV> <SOV> But they , when they had departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country . <EOV> <SOV> As thy went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon . <EOV> <SOV> And when the demon was cast out , the dumb spoke : and the multitudes marveled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel . <EOV> <SOV> But the Pharisees said , He casteth out demons , through the prince of the demons . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness , and every disease among the people . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to his disciples , The harvest truly is plentiful , but the laborers are few . <EOV> <SOV> Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he will send forth laborers into his harvest . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when he had called to him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness , and all manner of disease . <EOV> <SOV> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ; <EOV> <SOV> Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the publican ; James the son of Alpheus , and Lebbeus , whose surname was Thaddeus ; <EOV> <SOV> Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him . <EOV> <SOV> These twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and enter ye not into any city of the Samaritans . <EOV> <SOV> But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And as ye go , proclaim , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand . <EOV> <SOV> Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out demons : freely ye have received , freely give . <EOV> <SOV> Provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ; <EOV> <SOV> Nor bag for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor a staff : for the workman is worthy of his food . <EOV> <SOV> And into whatever city or town ye shall enter , inquire who in it is worthy , and there abide till ye go thence . <EOV> <SOV> And when ye come into a house , salute it . <EOV> <SOV> And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart from that house , or city , shake off the dust of your feet . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah , in the day of judgment , than for that city . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves . <EOV> <SOV> But beware of men : for they will deliver you to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles . <EOV> <SOV> But when they deliver you up , be not anxious how or what ye shall speak , for it shall be given to you in that same hour what ye shall speak . <EOV> <SOV> For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you . <EOV> <SOV> And the brother will deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children will rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will be hated by all men for my name 's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say to you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel till the Son of man shall have come . <EOV> <SOV> The disciple is not above his teacher , nor the servant above his lord . <EOV> <SOV> It is enough for the disciple that he should be as his teacher , and the servant as his lord : if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more will they call them of his household ? <EOV> <SOV> Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known . <EOV> <SOV> What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that publish ye upon the house - tops . <EOV> <SOV> And fear not them who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell . <EOV> <SOV> Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father . <EOV> <SOV> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered . <EOV> <SOV> Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But whoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword . <EOV> <SOV> For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law . <EOV> <SOV> And a man 's foes will be they of his own household . <EOV> <SOV> He that loveth father or mother more than me , is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me , is not worthy of me . <EOV> <SOV> And he that taketh not his cross , and followeth me , is not worthy of me . <EOV> <SOV> He that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake , shall find it . <EOV> <SOV> He that receiveth you , receiveth me , and he that receiveth me , receiveth him that sent me . <EOV> <SOV> He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet , shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man , shall receive a righteous man 's reward . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones , a cup of cold water only , in the name of a disciple , verily , I say to you , he shall in no wise lose his reward . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities . <EOV> <SOV> Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> And said to him , Art thou he that should come , or do we look for another ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , Go and show John again those things which ye hear and see : <EOV> <SOV> The blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised , and the poor have the gospel preached to them . <EOV> <SOV> And blessed is he to whom I shall not be the cause of his falling into sin . <EOV> <SOV> And as they departed , Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a reed shaken with the wind ? <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses . <EOV> <SOV> But what went ye out to see ? A prophet ? yes , I say to you , and more than a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> For this is he concerning whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee . <EOV> <SOV> Verily , I say to you , among them that are born of women , there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding , he that is least in the kingdom of heaven , is greater than he . <EOV> <SOV> And from the days of John the Baptist , until now , the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force . <EOV> <SOV> For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John . <EOV> <SOV> And if ye will receive it , this is Elijah who was to come . <EOV> <SOV> He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> But to what shall I liken this generation ? It is like to children sitting in the markets , and calling to their fellows , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , We have piped to you , and ye have not danced ; We have mourned to you , and ye have not lamented . <EOV> <SOV> For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a demon . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold , a man gluttonous , and a wine - bibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . But wisdom is justified by her children . <EOV> <SOV> Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done , because they repented not . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to thee , Chorazin ; woe to thee , Bethsaida : for if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you . <EOV> <SOV> And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom , in the day of judgment , than for thee . <EOV> <SOV> At that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them to babes . <EOV> <SOV> Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in thy sight . <EOV> <SOV> All things are delivered to me by my Father ; and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him . <EOV> <SOV> Come to me , all ye that labor , and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . <EOV> <SOV> Take my yoke upon you , and learn from me : for I am meek and lowly in heart ; and ye shall find rest to your souls . <EOV> <SOV> For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the corn , and his disciples were hungry , and began to pluck the ears of corn , and to eat . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Pharisees saw it , they said to him , Behold , thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry , and they that were with him ; <EOV> <SOV> How he entered into the house of God , and ate the show - bread , which it was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them who were with him , but only for the priests ? <EOV> <SOV> Or have ye not read in the law , that on the sabbath the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ? <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that in this place is one greater than the temple . <EOV> <SOV> But if ye had known what this meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had departed thence , he went into their synagogue . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a man who had his hand withered . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath ? that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it shall fall into a pit on the sabbath , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ? <EOV> <SOV> How much then is a man better than a sheep ? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to the man , Stretch out thy hand . And he stretched it out ; and it was restored to a sound state like the other . <EOV> <SOV> Then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> But when Jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all . <EOV> <SOV> And charged them that they should not make him known : <EOV> <SOV> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Behold , my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles . <EOV> <SOV> He shall not contend , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets . <EOV> <SOV> A bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he shall send forth judgment to victory . <EOV> <SOV> And in his name shall the Gentiles trust . <EOV> <SOV> Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon , blind and dumb ; and he healed him , so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw . <EOV> <SOV> And all the people were amazed , and said , Is not this the son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This man doth not cast out demons , but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus knew their thoughts , and said to them , Every kingdom divided against itself , is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself , shall not stand . <EOV> <SOV> And if Satan casteth out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how then shall his kingdom stand ? <EOV> <SOV> And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons , by whom do your children expel them ? therefore they shall be your judges . <EOV> <SOV> But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come to you . <EOV> <SOV> Or else , how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and seize his goods , except he shall first bind the strong man ? and then he will plunder his house . <EOV> <SOV> He that is not with me , is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me , scattereth abroad . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore I say to you , All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men : but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit shall not be forgiven to men . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come . <EOV> <SOV> Either make the tree good , and its fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by its fruit . <EOV> <SOV> O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart , the mouth speaketh . <EOV> <SOV> A good man , out of the good treasure of the heart , bringeth forth good things : and an evil man , out of the evil treasure , bringeth forth evil things . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , That for every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account in the day of judgment . <EOV> <SOV> For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned . <EOV> <SOV> Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered , saying , Master , we would see a sign from thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said to them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign , and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonah . <EOV> <SOV> For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly : so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth . <EOV> <SOV> The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and behold , a greater than Jonah is here . <EOV> <SOV> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and behold , a greater than Solomon is here . <EOV> <SOV> When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and he findeth none . <EOV> <SOV> Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished . <EOV> <SOV> Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . Even so shall it be also to this wicked generation . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then one said to him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said to him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ? <EOV> <SOV> And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren ! <EOV> <SOV> For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> The same day Jesus went out of the house , and sat by the sea side . <EOV> <SOV> And great multitudes were gathered to him , so that he went into a boat , and sat down ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore . <EOV> <SOV> And he spoke many things to them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ; <EOV> <SOV> And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them : <EOV> <SOV> Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth : <EOV> <SOV> And when the sun had risen , they were scorched ; and because they had not root , they withered . <EOV> <SOV> And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them : <EOV> <SOV> But others fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some a hundred - fold , some sixty - fold , some thirty - fold . <EOV> <SOV> Who hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples came , and said to him , Why speakest thou to them in parables ? <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said to them , Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given . <EOV> <SOV> For whoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that which he hath . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I speak to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand . <EOV> <SOV> And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive : <EOV> <SOV> For this people 's heart is become gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them . <EOV> <SOV> But blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear . <EOV> <SOV> For verily I say to you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear the things which ye hear , and have not heard them . <EOV> <SOV> Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower . <EOV> <SOV> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . This is he who received seed by the way side . <EOV> <SOV> But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and immediately with joy receiveth it ; <EOV> <SOV> Yet he hath not root in himself , but endureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , forthwith he is offended . <EOV> <SOV> He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> But he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; who also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some a hundred fold , some sixty , some thirty . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable he proposed to them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field : <EOV> <SOV> But while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and departed . <EOV> <SOV> But when the blade had sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also . <EOV> <SOV> So the servants of the householder came and said to him , Sir , didst thou not sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ? <EOV> <SOV> He said to them , An enemy hath done this . The servants said to him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them ? <EOV> <SOV> But he said , No ; lest while ye gather the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them . <EOV> <SOV> Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable he proposed to them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard - seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field : <EOV> <SOV> Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge on its branches . <EOV> <SOV> Another parable he spoke to them ; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened . <EOV> <SOV> All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables ; and without a parable he spoke not to them : <EOV> <SOV> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came to him , saying , Declare to us the parable of the tares of the field . <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said to them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ; <EOV> <SOV> The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ; <EOV> <SOV> The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels . <EOV> <SOV> As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them who do iniquity ; <EOV> <SOV> And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> Then shall the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field ; which , when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking goodly pearls : <EOV> <SOV> Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it . <EOV> <SOV> Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind : <EOV> <SOV> Which , when it was full , they drew to the shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast away the bad . <EOV> <SOV> So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just , <EOV> <SOV> And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , Have ye understood all these things ? They say to him , Yes , Lord . <EOV> <SOV> Then said he to them , Therefore every scribe who is instructed to the kingdom of heaven , is like a man that is a householder , who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ? <EOV> <SOV> Is not this the carpenter 's son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren , James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ? <EOV> <SOV> And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then hath this man all these things ? <EOV> <SOV> And they were offended in him . But Jesus said to them , A prophet is not without honor , save in his own country , and in his own house . <EOV> <SOV> And he did not many mighty works there , because of their unbelief . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus , <EOV> <SOV> And said to his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he hath risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him . <EOV> <SOV> For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias , his brother Philip 's wife . <EOV> <SOV> For John had said to him , It is not lawful for thee to have her . <EOV> <SOV> And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> But when Herod 's birth - day was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased Herod . <EOV> <SOV> Upon which he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask . <EOV> <SOV> And she , being before instructed by her mother , said , Give me here the head of John the Baptist in a dish . <EOV> <SOV> And the king was sorry : nevertheless for the sake of the oath , and of them who sat with him at table , he commanded it to be given her . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison . <EOV> <SOV> And his head was brought in a dish , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus heard of it , he departed thence in a boat , into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard of it , they followed him on foot out of the cities . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion towards them , and he healed their sick . <EOV> <SOV> And when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said to them , They need not depart ; give ye them to eat . <EOV> <SOV> And they say to him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes . <EOV> <SOV> He said , Bring them hither to me . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and broke , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate , and were satisfied : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full . <EOV> <SOV> And they that had eaten were about five thousand men , besides women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a boat , and to go before him to the other side , while he sent the multitudes away . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had sent the multitudes away , he ascended a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone . <EOV> <SOV> But the boat was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary . <EOV> <SOV> And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them , walking on the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear . <EOV> <SOV> But immediately Jesus spoke to them , saying , Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answered him and said , Lord , if it is thou , bid me come to thee on the water . <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Come . And when Peter had come down out of the boat , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> But when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said to him , O thou of little faith , Why didst thou doubt ? <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come into the boat , the wind ceased . <EOV> <SOV> Then they that were in the boat came and worshiped him , saying , In truth thou art the son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret . <EOV> <SOV> And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all the surrounding country , and brought to him all that were diseased ; <EOV> <SOV> And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were restored to health . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees , who were of Jerusalem , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said to them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ? <EOV> <SOV> For God commanded , saying , Honor thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death . <EOV> <SOV> But ye say , Whoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatever thou mightest be profited by me ; <EOV> <SOV> And honor not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition . <EOV> <SOV> Ye hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy of you , saying , <EOV> <SOV> This people draw nigh to me with their mouth , and honor me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me . <EOV> <SOV> But in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men . <EOV> <SOV> And he called the multitude , and said to them , Hear , and understand : <EOV> <SOV> Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man . <EOV> <SOV> Then came his disciples , and said to him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying ? <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be extirpated . <EOV> <SOV> Let them alone : they are blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind leadeth the blind , both will fall into the ditch . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered Peter and said to him , Declare to us this parable . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ? <EOV> <SOV> Do ye not yet understand , that whatever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ? <EOV> <SOV> But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man . <EOV> <SOV> For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies : <EOV> <SOV> These are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus went thence , and departed into the territories of Tyre and Sidon . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , a woman of Canaan came out of the same territories , and cried to him , saying , Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou son of David ; my daughter is grievously afflicted with a demon . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Then came she and worshiped him , saying , Lord , help me . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it to dogs . <EOV> <SOV> And she said , Truth , Lord : yet the dogs eat of the crums which fall from their master 's table . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus answered and said to her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it to thee even as thou wilt . And her daughter was healed from that very hour . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh to the sea of Galilee ; and ascended a mountain , and sat down there . <EOV> <SOV> And great multitudes came to him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them : <EOV> <SOV> So that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus called his disciples to him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples say to him , Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to satisfy so great a multitude ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus saith to them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few little fishes . <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the multitude to sit on the ground . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and broke them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they all ate and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that were left seven baskets full . <EOV> <SOV> And they that had eaten were four thousand men , besides women and children . <EOV> <SOV> And he sent away the multitude , and took a boat , and came into the borders of Magdala . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> The Pharisees also and the Sadducees came , and , tempting , desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven . <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said to them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red . <EOV> <SOV> And in the morning , It will be foul weather to - day : for the sky is red and lowering . O ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ? <EOV> <SOV> A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign ; and there shall no sign been to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonah . And he left them , and departed . <EOV> <SOV> And when his disciples had come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus said to them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have taken no bread . <EOV> <SOV> Which when Jesus perceived , he said to them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ? <EOV> <SOV> Do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? <EOV> <SOV> Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ? <EOV> <SOV> How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees ? <EOV> <SOV> Then they understood that he did not caution them against the leaven of bread , but against the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus came into the borders of Cesarea Phillippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Who do men say that I the Son of man am ? <EOV> <SOV> And they said , Some say that thou art John the Baptist : some Elijah ; and others , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , But who say ye that I am ? <EOV> <SOV> And Simon Peter answered and said , Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to him , Blessed art thou , Simon - Barjona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee , but my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And I say also to thee , that thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church : and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it . <EOV> <SOV> And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatever thou shalt bind on earth , shall be bound in heaven ; and whatever thou shalt loose on earth , shall be loosed in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ . <EOV> <SOV> From that time forth Jesus began to show to his disciples , that he must go to Jerusalem , and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day . <EOV> <SOV> Then Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall not be to thee . <EOV> <SOV> But he turned , and said to Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan ; thou art an offense to me : for thou savorest not the things that are of God , but those that are of men . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to his disciples , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> For whoever will save his life , shall lose it : and whoever will lose his life for my sake , shall find it . <EOV> <SOV> For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father , with his angels ; and then he will reward every man according to his works . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , There are some standing here , who shall not taste death , till they shall see the Son of man coming in his kingdom . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And after six days , Jesus taketh Peter , James , and John his brother , and bringeth them upon a high mountain apart . <EOV> <SOV> And he was transfigured before them : and his face shone as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered Peter , and said to Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> While he was yet speaking , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold , a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased : hear ye him . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were in great fear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus came and touched them , and said , Arise , and be not afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were descending the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be raised again from the dead . <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the scribes , that Elijah must first come ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to them , Elijah truly will first come , and restore all things : <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , that Elijah is come already , and they knew him not , but have done to him whatever they pleased : likewise will also the Son of man suffer by them . <EOV> <SOV> Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Baptist . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Lord , have mercy on my son ; for he is lunatic , and grievously distressed ; for often he falleth into the fire , and often into the water . <EOV> <SOV> And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him . <EOV> <SOV> Then Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him hither to me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked the demon , and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour . <EOV> <SOV> Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast him out ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Because of your unbelief : for verily I say to you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard - seed , ye shall say to this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place , and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible to you . <EOV> <SOV> However , this kind goeth not out , but by prayer and fasting . <EOV> <SOV> And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said to them , The Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men : <EOV> <SOV> And they will kill him , and the third day he will be raised again : And they were exceedingly grieved . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come to Capernaum , they that received tribute - money , came to Peter , and said , Doth not your Master pay tribute ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith , Yes . And when he had come into the house , Jesus anticipated him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? from whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ? from their own children , or from strangers ? <EOV> <SOV> Peter saith to him , From strangers . Jesus saith to him , Then are the children free . <EOV> <SOV> Notwithstanding , lest we should offend them , go thou to the sea , and cast a hook , and take the fish that first cometh up : and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a piece of money : take that , and give to them for me and thee . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> At the same time came the disciples to Jesus , saying , Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus called a little child to him , and set him in the midst of them , <EOV> <SOV> And said , Verily I say to you , Except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name , receiveth me . <EOV> <SOV> But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me , to sin , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to the world because of offenses ! for it must needs be that offenses come ; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh ! <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore , if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to sin , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet , to be cast into everlasting fire . <EOV> <SOV> And if thy eye causeth thee to sin , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes , to be cast into hell - fire . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones : for I say to you , that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost . <EOV> <SOV> How think ye ? if a man hath a hundred sheep , and one of them is gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and go to the mountains , and seek that which is gone astray ? <EOV> <SOV> And if he findeth it , verily I say to you , he rejoiceth more over that sheep , than over the ninety and nine which went not astray . <EOV> <SOV> Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish . <EOV> <SOV> Moreover , if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother . <EOV> <SOV> But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established . <EOV> <SOV> And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it to the church : but if he shall neglect to hear the church , let him be to thee as a heathen and a publican . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Whatever ye shall bind on earth , shall be bound in heaven : and whatever ye shall loose on earth , shall be loosed in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Again I say to you , That if two of you shall agree on earth , concerning any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> For where two or three are assembled in my name , there am I in the midst of them . <EOV> <SOV> Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , I say not to thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king who would take account of his servants . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents . <EOV> <SOV> But as he had not ability to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made . <EOV> <SOV> The servant therefore fell down , and worshiped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all . <EOV> <SOV> Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt . <EOV> <SOV> But the same servant went out , and found one of his fellow - servants , who owed him a hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me what thou owest . <EOV> <SOV> And his fellow - servant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all . <EOV> <SOV> And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt . <EOV> <SOV> So when his fellow - servants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done . <EOV> <SOV> Then his lord , having called him , said to him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me : <EOV> <SOV> Shouldst thou not also have had compassion on thy fellow - servant , even as I had pity on thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due to him . <EOV> <SOV> So likewise shall my heavenly Father do to you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the borders of Judea , beyond Jordan : <EOV> <SOV> And great multitudes followed him , and he healed them there . <EOV> <SOV> The Pharisees also came to him , tempting him , and saying to him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said to them , Have ye not read , that he who made them , at the beginning made them male and female , <EOV> <SOV> And said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they two shall be one flesh ? <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore they are no more two , but one flesh . Therefore what God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ? <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , Moses , because of the hardness of your hearts , suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so . <EOV> <SOV> And I say to you , Whoever shall put away his wife , except for lewdness , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoever marrieth her who is put away , committeth adultery . <EOV> <SOV> His disciples say to him , If the case of the man is so with his wife , it is not good to marry . <EOV> <SOV> But he said to them , All men can not receive this saying , save they to whom it is given . <EOV> <SOV> For there are some eunuchs , who were so born from their mothers womb : and there are some eunuchs , who were made eunuchs by men : and there are eunuchs , who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . He that is able to receive it , let him receive it . <EOV> <SOV> Then were brought to him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not to come to me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , one came and said to him , Good Master , what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said to him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments . <EOV> <SOV> He saith to him , Which ? Jesus said , Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness , <EOV> <SOV> Honor thy father and thy mother : and , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> The young man saith to him , All these things have I kept from my youth : what lack I yet ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell what thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me . <EOV> <SOV> But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to his disciples , Verily I say to you , that a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> And again I say to you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . <EOV> <SOV> When his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , Who then can be saved ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus beheld them , and said to them , With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered Peter , and said to him , Behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ? what shall we have therefore ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , Verily I say to you , that ye who have followed me in the regeneration , when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . <EOV> <SOV> And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands for my name 's sake , shall receive a hundred - fold , and shall inherit everlasting life . <EOV> <SOV> But many that are first shall be last , and the last shall be first . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is a householder , who went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the market - place , <EOV> <SOV> And said to them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatever is right , I will give you . And they departed . <EOV> <SOV> Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise . <EOV> <SOV> And about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith to them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith to them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatever is right , that shall ye receive . <EOV> <SOV> So when evening was come , the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward , Call the laborers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last to the first . <EOV> <SOV> And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny . <EOV> <SOV> But when the first came , they supposed that they should receive more ; and they likewise received every man a penny . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had received it , they murmured against the master of the house . <EOV> <SOV> Saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal to us , who have borne the burden and heat of the day . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered one of them , and said , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst thou not agree with me for a penny ? <EOV> <SOV> Take that which is thine , and depart : I will give to this last , even as to thee . <EOV> <SOV> Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own ? is thy eye evil because I am good ? <EOV> <SOV> So the last shall be first , and the first last : for many are called , but few chosen . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus going up to Jerusalem , took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said to them , <EOV> <SOV> Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests , and to the scribes , and they will condemn him to death , <EOV> <SOV> And will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he will rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Then came to him the mother of Zebedee 's children , with her sons , worshiping him , and desiring a certain thing of him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , What wilt thou : She saith to him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left in thy kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? They say to him , We are able . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Ye shall drink indeed of my cup , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by my Father . <EOV> <SOV> And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren . <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus called them to him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them . <EOV> <SOV> But it shall not be so among you : but whoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ; <EOV> <SOV> And whoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant : <EOV> <SOV> Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . <EOV> <SOV> And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , two blind men sitting by the way - side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou son of David . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude rebuked them , that they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou son of David . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do to you ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened . <EOV> <SOV> So Jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem , and had come to Bethphage , to the mount of Olives , then Jesus sent two disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Saying to them , Go into the village over against you , and immediately ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her , loose them , and bring them to me . <EOV> <SOV> And if any man shall say aught to you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and immediately he will send them . <EOV> <SOV> All this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , <EOV> <SOV> Tell ye the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy King cometh to thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples went , and did as Jesus commanded them , <EOV> <SOV> And brought the ass and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon . <EOV> <SOV> And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strewed them in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the son of David : blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ? <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the money - changers , and the seats of them that sold doves . <EOV> <SOV> And said to them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer , but ye have made it a den of thieves . <EOV> <SOV> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them . <EOV> <SOV> And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the son of David ; they were greatly displeased , <EOV> <SOV> And said to him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus saith to them , Yes : have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ? <EOV> <SOV> And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany , and he lodged there . <EOV> <SOV> Now in the morning as he was returning into the city , he was hungry . <EOV> <SOV> And when he saw a fig - tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing on it , but leaves only , and said to it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever . And immediately the fig - tree withered . <EOV> <SOV> And when the disciples saw it , they marveled , saying , How soon is the fig - tree withered ! <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , Verily I say to you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig - tree , but also , if ye shall say to this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done . <EOV> <SOV> And all things whatever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ; and who gave thee this authority ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I also will tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or from men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , if we shall say , From heaven ; he will say to us , Why then did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> But if we shall say , From men ; we fear the people : for all hold John as a prophet . <EOV> <SOV> And they answered Jesus , and said , We can not tell . And he said to them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . <EOV> <SOV> But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go , work to - day in my vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> He answered and said , I will not ; but afterward he repented , and went . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I go , sir : and went not . <EOV> <SOV> Which of the two did the will of his father ? They say to him , The first . Jesus saith to them , Verily I say to you , that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you . <EOV> <SOV> For John came to you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him . <EOV> <SOV> Hear another parable ; There was a certain householder , who planted a vineyard , and hedged it around , and digged a wine - press in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a remote country : <EOV> <SOV> And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it . <EOV> <SOV> And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another . <EOV> <SOV> Again he sent other servants more than the first : and they did to them in like manner . <EOV> <SOV> But last of all he sent to them his son , saying , They will reverence my son . <EOV> <SOV> But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance . <EOV> <SOV> And they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore the Lord of the vineyard cometh , what will he do to those husbandmen ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard to other husbandmen , who will render him the fruits in their seasons . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord 's doing , and it is marvelous in our eyes ? <EOV> <SOV> Therefore I say to you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall fall on this stone , shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder . <EOV> <SOV> And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spoke of them . <EOV> <SOV> But when they sought to lay hands on him , they feared the multitude , because they took him for a prophet . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus answered , and spoke to them again by parables , and said , <EOV> <SOV> The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king , who made a marriage for his son , <EOV> <SOV> And sent his servants to call them that were invited to the wedding : and they would not come . <EOV> <SOV> Again , he sent other servants , saying , Tell them who are invited , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come to the marriage . <EOV> <SOV> But they made light of it , and went , one to his farm , another to his merchandise . <EOV> <SOV> And the remnant took his servants , and treated them spitefully , and slew them . <EOV> <SOV> But when the king heard of it , he was wroth : and he sent his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city . <EOV> <SOV> Then he saith to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they who were invited were not worthy . <EOV> <SOV> Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , invite to the marriage . <EOV> <SOV> So those servants went out into the highways , and collected all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests . <EOV> <SOV> And when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who had not a wedding - garment : <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to him , Friend , how camest thou in hither , not having a wedding - garment ? And he was speechless . <EOV> <SOV> Then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into utter darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> For many are called , but few are chosen . <EOV> <SOV> Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk . <EOV> <SOV> And they sent out to him their disciples , with the Herodians , saying , Master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men . <EOV> <SOV> Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar , or not ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ? <EOV> <SOV> Show me the tribute - money . And they brought to him a penny . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , Whose is this image , and superscription ? <EOV> <SOV> They say to him , Cesar 's . Then saith he to them , Render therefore to Cesar , the things which are Cesar 's ; and to God , the things that are God 's . <EOV> <SOV> When they had heard these words , they marveled , and left him , and departed . <EOV> <SOV> The same day came to him the Sadducees , who say that there is no resurrection , and asked him , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man shall die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> Now there were with us seven brothers : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased ; and having no issue , left his wife to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise the second also , and the third , to the seventh . <EOV> <SOV> And last of all the woman died also . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore in the resurrection , whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus answered and said to them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God . <EOV> <SOV> For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> But as concerning the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God , saying , <EOV> <SOV> I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living . <EOV> <SOV> And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine . <EOV> <SOV> But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were assembled about him . <EOV> <SOV> Then one of them who was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying , <EOV> <SOV> Master , which is the great commandment in the law ? <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind . <EOV> <SOV> This is the first and great commandment . <EOV> <SOV> And the second is like it , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . <EOV> <SOV> On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> While the Pharisees were assembled , Jesus asked them , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , What think ye of Christ ? whose son is he ? They say to him , The son of David . <EOV> <SOV> He saith to them , How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying , <EOV> <SOV> The LORD said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thy enemies thy footstool ? <EOV> <SOV> If David then calleth him Lord , how is he his son ? <EOV> <SOV> And no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man , from that day forth , ask him any more questions . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then Jesus spoke to the multitude , and to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses 's seat . <EOV> <SOV> All therefore , whatever they bid you observe , that observe and do : but do not ye according to their works : for they say , and do not . <EOV> <SOV> For they bind heavy burdens , and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers . <EOV> <SOV> But all their works they do to be seen by men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments , <EOV> <SOV> And love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues , <EOV> <SOV> And greetings in the markets , and to be called by men , Rabbi , Rabbi . <EOV> <SOV> But be not ye called Rabbi : for one is your Master , even Christ ; and all ye are brethren . <EOV> <SOV> And call no man your father upon the earth : for one is your Father who is in heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Neither be ye called masters : for one is your master , even Christ . <EOV> <SOV> But he that is greatest among you , shall be your servant . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall exalt himself , shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself , shall be exalted . <EOV> <SOV> But woe to you , scribes and Pharisees ! hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering , to go in . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretense make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is made , ye make him two - fold more the child of hell than yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , ye blind guides , who say , Whoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor . <EOV> <SOV> Ye fools , and blind : for which is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ? <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is guilty . <EOV> <SOV> Ye fools , and blind : for which is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ? <EOV> <SOV> Whoever therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things upon it . <EOV> <SOV> And whoever shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth in it . <EOV> <SOV> And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth upon it . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint , and anise , and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ye ought to have done , and not to leave the others undone . <EOV> <SOV> Ye blind guides , who strain out a gnat , and swallow a camel . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess . <EOV> <SOV> Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like whitened sepulchers , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness . <EOV> <SOV> Thus ye also outwardly appear righteous to men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity . <EOV> <SOV> Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous , <EOV> <SOV> And say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore ye are witnesses to yourselves , that ye are the children of them who killed the prophets . <EOV> <SOV> Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers . <EOV> <SOV> Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ? <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore behold , I send to you prophets , and wise men , and scribes ; and some of them ye will kill and crucify , and some of them ye will scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city : <EOV> <SOV> That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel , to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , all these things shall come upon this generation . <EOV> <SOV> O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them who are sent to thee , how often would I have gathered thy children , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not ! <EOV> <SOV> Behold , your house is left to you desolate . <EOV> <SOV> For I say to you , Ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say to you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . <EOV> <SOV> And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came to him privately , saying , Tell us , when will these things be ? and what will be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ? <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answered and said to them , Take heed that no man deceive you . <EOV> <SOV> For many will come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and will deceive many . <EOV> <SOV> And ye will hear of wars , and rumors of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet . <EOV> <SOV> For nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there will be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes in divers places . <EOV> <SOV> All these are the beginning of sorrows . <EOV> <SOV> Then will they deliver you up to be afflicted , and will kill you : and ye will be hated by all nations for my name 's sake . <EOV> <SOV> And then will many be offended , and will betray one another , and will hate one another . <EOV> <SOV> And many false prophets will rise , and will deceive many . <EOV> <SOV> And because iniquity will abound , the love of many will become cold . <EOV> <SOV> But he that shall endure to the end , the same shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world , for a testimony to all nations ; and then shall the end come . <EOV> <SOV> When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoever readeth , let him understand , ) <EOV> <SOV> Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains : <EOV> <SOV> Let him who is on the house - top not come down to take any thing out of his house : <EOV> <SOV> Neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes . <EOV> <SOV> And woe to them that are with child , and to them that nurse infants in those days ! <EOV> <SOV> But pray ye that your flight may not be in the winter , neither on the sabbath : <EOV> <SOV> For then shall be great tribulation , such as hath not been since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be . <EOV> <SOV> And except those days should be shortened , there would no flesh be saved : but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shortened . <EOV> <SOV> Then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ , or there ; believe it not . <EOV> <SOV> For false Christs will arise , and false prophets , and will show great signs and wonders ; so that , if it were possible , they would deceive the very elect . <EOV> <SOV> Behold , I have told you before . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore , if they shall say to you , Behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not . <EOV> <SOV> For as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even to the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be . <EOV> <SOV> For wherever the carcass is , there will the eagles be collected . <EOV> <SOV> Immediately after the tribulation of those days , shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken : <EOV> <SOV> And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory . <EOV> <SOV> And he will send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they will gather his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other . <EOV> <SOV> Now learn a parable of the fig - tree ; When its branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh : <EOV> <SOV> So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things shall be fulfilled . <EOV> <SOV> Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> But of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my Father only . <EOV> <SOV> But as the days of Noah were , so will also the coming of the Son of man be . <EOV> <SOV> For as in the days that were before the flood , they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , <EOV> <SOV> And knew not until the flood came , and took them all away : so also will be the coming of the Son of man . <EOV> <SOV> Then will two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left . <EOV> <SOV> Two women will be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore ; for ye know not what hour your Lord cometh . <EOV> <SOV> But know this , that if the master of the house knew in what watch the thief would come , he would watch , and would not suffer his house to be broken up . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not , the Son of man cometh . <EOV> <SOV> Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his Lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them food in due season ? <EOV> <SOV> Blessed is that servant , whom his lord , when he cometh , shall find so doing . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , that he will make him ruler over all his goods . <EOV> <SOV> But if that evil servant shall say in his heart , My Lord delayeth his coming ; <EOV> <SOV> And shall begin to beat his fellow - servants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ; <EOV> <SOV> The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of , <EOV> <SOV> And will cut him asunder , and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins , who took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom . <EOV> <SOV> And five of them were wise , and five were foolish . <EOV> <SOV> They that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them : <EOV> <SOV> But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps . <EOV> <SOV> While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept . <EOV> <SOV> And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him . <EOV> <SOV> Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps . <EOV> <SOV> And the foolish said to the wise , Give us of your oil : for our lamps are gone out . <EOV> <SOV> But the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves . <EOV> <SOV> And while they were going to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready , went in with him to the marriage , and the door was shut . <EOV> <SOV> Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us . <EOV> <SOV> But he answered and said , Verily I say to you , I know you not . <EOV> <SOV> Watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man cometh . <EOV> <SOV> For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered to them his goods . <EOV> <SOV> And to one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and forthwith took his journey . <EOV> <SOV> Then he that had received the five talents , went and traded with the same , and gained other five talents . <EOV> <SOV> And likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two . <EOV> <SOV> But he that had received one , went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money . <EOV> <SOV> After a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and reckoneth with them . <EOV> <SOV> And he that had received five talents , came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst to me five talents : behold , I have gained besides them five talents more . <EOV> <SOV> His lord said to him , Well done thou good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> He also that had received two talents came , and said , Lord , thou deliveredst to me two talents : behold , I have gained two other talents besides them . <EOV> <SOV> His lord said to him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord . <EOV> <SOV> Then he who had received the one talent came , and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art a hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strewed : <EOV> <SOV> And I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast what is thine . <EOV> <SOV> His lord answered and said to him , Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I have not sown , and gather where I have not strewed : <EOV> <SOV> Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received my own with interest . <EOV> <SOV> Take therefore the talent from him , and give it to him who hath ten talents . <EOV> <SOV> For to every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath . <EOV> <SOV> And cast ye the unprofitable servant into utter darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . <EOV> <SOV> When the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then will he sit upon the throne of his glory : <EOV> <SOV> And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he will separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats : <EOV> <SOV> And he will set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left . <EOV> <SOV> Then will the King say to them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world : <EOV> <SOV> For I was hungry , and ye gave me food : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in : <EOV> <SOV> Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came to me . <EOV> <SOV> Then will the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungry , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ? <EOV> <SOV> When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And the king will answer and say to them , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it to me . <EOV> <SOV> Then will he say also to them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels : <EOV> <SOV> For I was hungry , and ye gave me no food : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink : <EOV> <SOV> I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not . <EOV> <SOV> Then will they also answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee hungry , or thirsty , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister to thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Then will he answer them , saying , Verily I say to you , Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me . <EOV> <SOV> And these shall go away into everlasting punishment : but the righteous into life eternal . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said to his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> Ye know that after two days is the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> Then assembled the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , in the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas , <EOV> <SOV> And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him . <EOV> <SOV> But they said , Not on the feast - day , lest there be an uproar among the people . <EOV> <SOV> Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , <EOV> <SOV> There came to him a woman having an alabaster - box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head as he sat at table . <EOV> <SOV> But when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ? <EOV> <SOV> For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor . <EOV> <SOV> When Jesus understood it , he said to them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me . <EOV> <SOV> For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always . <EOV> <SOV> For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , which this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her . <EOV> <SOV> Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went to the chief priests , <EOV> <SOV> And said , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him to you ? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver . <EOV> <SOV> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him . <EOV> <SOV> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread , the disciples came to Jesus , saying to him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ? <EOV> <SOV> And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say to him , The Master saith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the evening was come , he sat down with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating , he said , Verily I say to you , that one of you will betray me . <EOV> <SOV> And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say to him , Lord , is it I ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same will betray me . <EOV> <SOV> The Son of man goeth , as it is written concerning him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man , if he had not been born . <EOV> <SOV> Then Judas , who betrayed him , answered and said , Master , is it I ? He said to him , Thou hast said . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and broke it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body . <EOV> <SOV> And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ; <EOV> <SOV> For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sin . <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father 's kingdom . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had sung a hymn , they went out to the mount of Olives . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Jesus to them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad . <EOV> <SOV> But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> Peter answered and said to him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus said to him , Verily I say to thee , that this night , before the cock shall crow , thou wilt deny me thrice . <EOV> <SOV> Peter said to him , Though I should die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples . <EOV> <SOV> Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane , and saith to the disciples , Sit ye here , while I go yonder and pray . <EOV> <SOV> And he took with him Peter , and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith he to them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even to death : tarry ye here , and watch with me . <EOV> <SOV> And he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless , not as I will , but as thou wilt . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh to the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith to Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ? <EOV> <SOV> Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . <EOV> <SOV> He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , thy will be done . <EOV> <SOV> And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy . <EOV> <SOV> And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words . <EOV> <SOV> Then he cometh to his disciples , and saith to them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners . <EOV> <SOV> Rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me . <EOV> <SOV> And while he was yet speaking , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staffs , from the chief priests and elders of the people . <EOV> <SOV> Now he that betrayed him , gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; hold him fast . <EOV> <SOV> And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , Hail Master ; and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , Friend , Why art thou come ? Then they came , and laid hands on Jesus , and took him . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , one of them , who were with Jesus , stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest , and smote off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to him , Put up again thy sword into its place : for all they that take the sword , shall perish by the sword . <EOV> <SOV> Thinkest thou that I can not now pray to my Father , and he will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ? <EOV> <SOV> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ? <EOV> <SOV> In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staffs to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me . <EOV> <SOV> But all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled . <EOV> <SOV> And they that had laid hold on Jesus , led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled . <EOV> <SOV> But Peter followed him at a distance , to the high priest 's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants to see the end . <EOV> <SOV> Now the chief priests and elders , and all the council , sought false testimony against Jesus , to put him to death ; <EOV> <SOV> But found none : and , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses , <EOV> <SOV> And said , This man said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days . <EOV> <SOV> And the high priest arose , and said to him , Answerest thou nothing , what is it which these testify against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest answered and said to him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus saith to him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say to you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy . <EOV> <SOV> What think ye ? They answered and said , He is guilty of death . <EOV> <SOV> Then they spit in his face , and buffetted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Prophesy to us , thou Christ , Who is he that smote thee ? <EOV> <SOV> Now Peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came to him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he had gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said to them that were there , This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth . <EOV> <SOV> And again he denied with an oath , I do not know the man . <EOV> <SOV> And after a while came to him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech betrayeth thee . <EOV> <SOV> Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crowed . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , who said to him , Before the cock shall crow , thou wilt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> When the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor . <EOV> <SOV> Then Judas , who had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood . And they said , What is that to us ? see thou to that . <EOV> <SOV> And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not lawful to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood . <EOV> <SOV> And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in . <EOV> <SOV> Wherefore that field has been called , The field of blood , to this day . <EOV> <SOV> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of Israel did value ; <EOV> <SOV> And gave them for the potter 's field , as the Lord appointed me . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said to him , Thou sayest . <EOV> <SOV> And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing . <EOV> <SOV> Then saith Pilate to him , Hearest thou not how many things they testify against thee ? <EOV> <SOV> And he answered him to not a word ; so that the governor marveled greatly . <EOV> <SOV> Now at that feast , the governor was wo nt to release to the people a prisoner , whom they would . <EOV> <SOV> And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas . <EOV> <SOV> Therefore when they were assembled , Pilate said to them , Whom will ye that I release to you ? Barabbas , or Jesus , who is called Christ ? <EOV> <SOV> ( For he knew that for envy they had delivered him . ) <EOV> <SOV> When he was sitting on the judgment - seat , his wife sent to him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream , because of him . <EOV> <SOV> But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> The governor answered and said to them , Which of the two will ye that I release to you ? They said , Barabbas . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate saith to them , What shall I do then with Jesus , who is called Christ ? They all say to him , Let him be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it . <EOV> <SOV> Then answered all the people , and said , His blood be on us , and on our children . <EOV> <SOV> Then he released Barabbas to them : and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered to him the whole band of soldiers . <EOV> <SOV> And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews ? <EOV> <SOV> And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and struck him on the head . <EOV> <SOV> And after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they constrained to bear his cross . <EOV> <SOV> And when they had come to a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull , <EOV> <SOV> They gave him vinegar to drink , mingled with gall : and when he had tasted of it , he would not drink . <EOV> <SOV> And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture they cast lots . <EOV> <SOV> And sitting down , they watched him there : <EOV> <SOV> And set up over his head his accusation written , THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS . <EOV> <SOV> Then were there two thieves crucified with him : one on the right hand , and another on the left . <EOV> <SOV> And they that passed by , reviled him , wagging their heads , <EOV> <SOV> And saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . If thou art the Son of God , come down from the cross . <EOV> <SOV> Likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said , <EOV> <SOV> He saved others ; himself he can not save . If he is King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him . <EOV> <SOV> He trusted in God ; let him deliver him now if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> The thieves also who were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth . <EOV> <SOV> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land to the ninth hour . <EOV> <SOV> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? <EOV> <SOV> Some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for Elijah . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink . <EOV> <SOV> The rest said , Forbear , let us see whether Elijah will come to save him . <EOV> <SOV> Jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , expired . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , the vail of the temple was rent in two , from the top to the bottom : and the earth shook , and the rocks rent ; <EOV> <SOV> And the graves were opened , and many bodies of saints who slept , arose , <EOV> <SOV> And came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared to many . <EOV> <SOV> Now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> And many women were there ( beholding at a distance ) who followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering to him : <EOV> <SOV> Among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedee 's children . <EOV> <SOV> When the evening was come , there came a rich man of Arimathea , named Joseph , who also himself was a disciple of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> He went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered . <EOV> <SOV> And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth , <EOV> <SOV> And laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock ; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher , and departed . <EOV> <SOV> And there was Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , After three days I will rise again . <EOV> <SOV> Command therefore that the sepulcher be made secure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say to the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last error will be worse than the first . <EOV> <SOV> Pilate said to them , Ye have a watch : go , make it as secure as ye can . <EOV> <SOV> So they went , and having sealed the stone , made the sepulcher secure with a watch . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary to see the sepulcher . <EOV> <SOV> And behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it . <EOV> <SOV> His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow . <EOV> <SOV> And for fear of him the keepers trembled and became as dead men . <EOV> <SOV> And the angel answered and said to the women , Fear ye not : for I know that ye seek Jesus , who was crucified . <EOV> <SOV> He is not here : for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay . <EOV> <SOV> And go quickly , and tell his disciples , that he is risen from the dead , and behold , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you . <EOV> <SOV> And they departed quickly from the sepulcher , with fear and great joy ; and ran to bring word to his disciples . <EOV> <SOV> And as they were going to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . And they came , and held him by the feet , and worshiped him . <EOV> <SOV> Then said Jesus to them , Be not afraid : go tell my brethren , that they go into Galilee , and there shall they see me . <EOV> <SOV> Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and showed to the chief priests all the things that had been done . <EOV> <SOV> And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers , <EOV> <SOV> Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept . <EOV> <SOV> And if this shall come to the governor 's ears , we will persuade him , and secure you . <EOV> <SOV> So they took the money , and did as they were instructed : and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day . <EOV> <SOV> Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee , to a mountain where Jesus had appointed them . <EOV> <SOV> And when they saw him , they worshiped him : but some doubted . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus came , and spoke to them , saying , All power is given to me in heaven and upon earth . <EOV> <SOV> Go ye therefore and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you : and lo , I am with you always , even to the end of the world . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
