<SOC> <SOV> A beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ , Son of God . <EOV> <SOV> As it hath been written in the prophets , ' Lo , I send My messenger before thy face , who shall prepare thy way before thee , ' -- <EOV> <SOV> ' A voice of one calling in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , straight make ye his paths , ' -- <EOV> <SOV> John came baptizing in the wilderness , and proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins , <EOV> <SOV> and there were going forth to him all the region of Judea , and they of Jerusalem , and they were all baptized by him in the river Jordan , confessing their sins . <EOV> <SOV> And John was clothed with camel 's hair , and a girdle of skin around his loins , and eating locusts and honey of the field , <EOV> <SOV> and he proclaimed , saying , ' He doth come -- who is mightier than I -- after me , of whom I am not worthy -- having stooped down -- to loose the latchet of his sandals ; <EOV> <SOV> I indeed did baptize you with water , but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass in those days , Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized by John at the Jordan ; <EOV> <SOV> and immediately coming up from the water , he saw the heavens dividing , and the Spirit as a dove coming down upon him ; <EOV> <SOV> and a voice came out of the heavens , ' Thou art My Son -- the Beloved , in whom I did delight . ' <EOV> <SOV> And immediately doth the Spirit put him forth to the wilderness , <EOV> <SOV> and he was there in the wilderness forty days , being tempted by the Adversary , and he was with the beasts , and the messengers were ministering to him . <EOV> <SOV> And after the delivering up of John , Jesus came to Galilee , proclaiming the good news of the reign of God , <EOV> <SOV> and saying -- ' Fulfilled hath been the time , and the reign of God hath come nigh , reform ye , and believe in the good news . ' <EOV> <SOV> And , walking by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon , and Andrew his brother , casting a drag into the sea , for they were fishers , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to them , ' Come ye after me , and I shall make you to become fishers of men ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately , having left their nets , they followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And having gone on thence a little , he saw James of Zebedee , and John his brother , and they were in the boat refitting the nets , <EOV> <SOV> and immediately he called them , and , having left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants , they went away after him . <EOV> <SOV> And they go on to Capernaum , and immediately , on the sabbaths , having gone into the synagogue , he was teaching , <EOV> <SOV> and they were astonished at his teaching , for he was teaching them as having authority , and not as the scribes . <EOV> <SOV> And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit , and he cried out , <EOV> <SOV> saying , ' Away ! what -- to us and to thee , Jesus the Nazarene ? thou didst come to destroy us ; I have known thee who thou art -- the Holy One of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus rebuked him , saying , ' Be silenced , and come forth out of him , ' <EOV> <SOV> and the unclean spirit having torn him , and having cried with a great voice , came forth out of him , <EOV> <SOV> and they were all amazed , so as to reason among themselves , saying , ' What is this ? what new teaching ' is ' this ? that with authority also the unclean spirits he commandeth , and they obey him ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And the fame of him went forth immediately to all the region , round about , of Galilee . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately , having come forth out of the synagogue , they went to the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John , <EOV> <SOV> and the mother - in - law of Simon was lying fevered , and immediately they tell him about her , <EOV> <SOV> and having come near , he raised her up , having laid hold of her hand , and the fever left her immediately , and she was ministering to them . <EOV> <SOV> And evening having come , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all who were ill , and who were demoniacs , <EOV> <SOV> and the whole city was gathered together near the door , <EOV> <SOV> and he healed many who were ill of manifold diseases , and many demons he cast forth , and was not suffering the demons to speak , because they knew him . <EOV> <SOV> And very early , it being yet night , having risen , he went forth , and went away to a desert place , and was there praying ; <EOV> <SOV> and Simon and those with him went in quest of him , <EOV> <SOV> and having found him , they say to him , -- ' All do seek thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' We may go to the next towns , that there also I may preach , for for this I came forth . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was preaching in their synagogues , in all Galilee , and is casting out the demons , <EOV> <SOV> and there doth come to him a leper , calling on him , and kneeling to him , and saying to him -- ' If thou mayest will , thou art able to cleanse me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having been moved with compassion , having stretched forth the hand , touched him , and saith to him , ' I will ; be thou cleansed ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he having spoken , immediately the leprosy went away from him , and he was cleansed . <EOV> <SOV> And having sternly charged him , immediately he put him forth , <EOV> <SOV> and saith to him , ' See thou mayest say nothing to any one , but go away , thyself shew to the priest , and bring near for thy cleansing the things Moses directed , for a testimony to them . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , having gone forth , began to proclaim much , and to spread abroad the thing , so that no more he was able openly to enter into the city , but he was without in desert places , and they were coming unto him from every quarter . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And again he entered into Capernaum , after ' some ' days , and it was heard that he is in the house , <EOV> <SOV> and immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even at the door , and he was speaking to them the word . <EOV> <SOV> And they come unto him , bringing a paralytic , borne by four , <EOV> <SOV> and not being able to come near to him because of the multitude , they uncovered the roof where he was , and , having broken ' it ' up , they let down the couch on which the paralytic was lying , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having seen their faith , saith to the paralytic , ' Child , thy sins have been forgiven thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there were certain of the scribes there sitting , and reasoning in their hearts , <EOV> <SOV> ' Why doth this one thus speak evil words ? who is able to forgive sins except one -- God ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus , having known in his spirit that they thus reason in themselves , said to them , ' Why these things reason ye in your hearts ? <EOV> <SOV> which is easier , to say to the paralytic , The sins have been forgiven to thee ? or to say , Rise , and take up thy couch , and walk ? <EOV> <SOV> ' And , that ye may know that the Son of Man hath authority on the earth to forgive sins -- ( he saith to the paralytic ) -- <EOV> <SOV> I say to thee , Rise , and take up thy couch , and go away to thy house ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he rose immediately , and having taken up the couch , he went forth before all , so that all were astonished , and do glorify God , saying -- ' Never thus did we see . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he went forth again by the sea , and all the multitude was coming unto him , and he was teaching them , <EOV> <SOV> and passing by , he saw Levi of Alpheus sitting at the tax - office , and saith to him , ' Be following me , ' and he , having risen , did follow him . <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass , in his reclining ( at meat ) in his house , that many tax - gatherers and sinners were reclining ( at meat ) with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him . <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the Pharisees , having seen him eating with the tax - gatherers and sinners , said to his disciples , ' Why -- that with the tax - gatherers and sinners he doth eat and drink ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having heard , saith to them , ' They who are strong have no need of a physician , but they who are ill ; I came not to call righteous men , but sinners to reformation . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting , and they come and say to him , ' Wherefore do the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast , and thy disciples do not fast ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them , ' Are the sons of the bride - chamber able , while the bridegroom is with them , to fast ? so long time as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast ; <EOV> <SOV> but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them , and then they shall fast -- in those days . <EOV> <SOV> ' And no one a patch of undressed cloth doth sew on an old garment , and if not -- the new filling it up doth take from the old and the rent doth become worse ; <EOV> <SOV> and no one doth put new wine into old skins , and if not -- the new wine doth burst the skins , and the wine is poured out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but new wine into new skins is to be put . ' <EOV> <SOV> And it came to pass -- he is going along on the sabbaths through the corn - fields -- and his disciples began to make a way , plucking the ears , <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees said to him , ' Lo , why do they on the sabbaths that which is not lawful ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Did ye never read what David did , when he had need and was hungry , he and those with him ? <EOV> <SOV> how he went into the house of God , ( at ' Abiathar the chief priest , ' ) and the loaves of the presentation did eat , which it is not lawful to eat , except to the priests , and he gave also to those who were with him ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' The sabbath for man was made , not man for the sabbath , <EOV> <SOV> so that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he entered again into the synagogue , and there was there a man having the hand withered , <EOV> <SOV> and they were watching him , whether on the sabbaths he will heal him , that they might accuse him . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to the man having the hand withered , ' Rise up in the midst . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , ' Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good , or to do evil ? life to save , or to kill ? ' but they were silent . <EOV> <SOV> And having looked round upon them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their heart , he saith to the man , ' Stretch forth thy hand ; ' and he stretched forth , and his hand was restored whole as the other ; <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees having gone forth , immediately , with the Herodians , were taking counsel against him how they might destroy him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus withdrew with his disciples unto the sea , and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judea , <EOV> <SOV> and from Jerusalem , and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon -- a great multitude -- having heard how great things he was doing , came unto him . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to his disciples that a little boat may wait on him , because of the multitude , that they may not press upon him , <EOV> <SOV> for he did heal many , so that they threw themselves on him , in order to touch him -- as many as had plagues ; <EOV> <SOV> and the unclean spirits , when they were seeing him , were falling down before him , and were crying , saying -- ' Thou art the Son of God ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and many times he was charging them that they might not make him manifest . <EOV> <SOV> And he goeth up to the mountain , and doth call near whom he willed , and they went away to him ; <EOV> <SOV> and he appointed twelve , that they may be with him , and that he may send them forth to preach , <EOV> <SOV> and to have power to heal the sicknesses , and to cast out the demons . <EOV> <SOV> And he put on Simon the name Peter ; <EOV> <SOV> and James of Zebedee , and John the brother of James , and he put on them names -- Boanerges , that is , ' Sons of thunder ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James of Alpheus , and Thaddeus , and Simon the Cananite , <EOV> <SOV> and Judas Iscariot , who did also deliver him up ; and they come into a house . <EOV> <SOV> And come together again doth a multitude , so that they are not able even to eat bread ; <EOV> <SOV> and his friends having heard , went forth to lay hold on him , for they said that he was beside himself , <EOV> <SOV> and the scribes who ' are ' from Jerusalem having come down , said -- ' He hath Beelzeboul , ' and -- ' By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons . ' <EOV> <SOV> And , having called them near , in similes he said to them , ' How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary ? <EOV> <SOV> and if a kingdom against itself be divided , that kingdom can not be made to stand ; <EOV> <SOV> and if a house against itself be divided , that house can not be made to stand ; <EOV> <SOV> and if the Adversary did rise against himself , and hath been divided , he can not be made to stand , but hath an end . <EOV> <SOV> ' No one is able the vessels of the strong man -- having entered into his house -- to spoil , if first he may not bind the strong man , and then his house he will spoil . <EOV> <SOV> ' Verily I say to you , that all the sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men , and evil speakings with which they might speak evil , <EOV> <SOV> but whoever may speak evil in regard to the Holy Spirit hath not forgiveness -- to the age , but is in danger of age - during judgment ; ' <EOV> <SOV> because they said , ' He hath an unclean spirit . ' <EOV> <SOV> Then come do his brethren and mother , and standing without , they sent unto him , calling him , <EOV> <SOV> and a multitude was sitting about him , and they said to him , ' Lo , thy mother and thy brethren without do seek thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answered them , saying , ' Who is my mother , or my brethren ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And having looked round in a circle to those sitting about him , he saith , ' Lo , my mother and my brethren ! <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may do the will of God , he is my brother , and my sister , and mother . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And again he began to teach by the sea , and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he , having gone into the boat , sat in the sea , and all the multitude was near the sea , on the land , <EOV> <SOV> and he taught them many things in similes , and he said to them in his teaching : <EOV> <SOV> ' Hearken , lo , the sower went forth to sow ; <EOV> <SOV> and it came to pass , in the sowing , some fell by the way , and the fowls of the heaven did come and devour it ; <EOV> <SOV> and other fell upon the rocky ground , where it had not much earth , and immediately it sprang forth , because of not having depth of earth , <EOV> <SOV> and the sun having risen , it was scorched , and because of not having root it did wither ; <EOV> <SOV> and other fell toward the thorns , and the thorns did come up , and choke it , and fruit it gave not ; <EOV> <SOV> and other fell to the good ground , and was giving fruit , coming up and increasing , and it bare , one thirty - fold , and one sixty , and one an hundred . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And when he was alone , those about him , with the twelve , did ask him of the simile , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' To you it hath been given to know the secret of the reign of God , but to those who are without , in similes are all the things done ; <EOV> <SOV> that seeing they may see and not perceive , and hearing they may hear and not understand , lest they may turn , and the sins may be forgiven them . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , ' Have ye not known this simile ? and how shall ye know all the similes ? <EOV> <SOV> He who is sowing doth sow the word ; <EOV> <SOV> and these are they by the way where the word is sown : and whenever they may hear , immediately cometh the Adversary , and he taketh away the word that hath been sown in their hearts . <EOV> <SOV> ' And these are they , in like manner , who on the rocky ground are sown : who , whenever they may hear the word , immediately with joy do receive it , <EOV> <SOV> and have not root in themselves , but are temporary ; afterward tribulation or persecution having come because of the word , immediately they are stumbled . <EOV> <SOV> ' And these are they who toward the thorns are sown : these are they who are hearing the word , <EOV> <SOV> and the anxieties of this age , and the deceitfulness of the riches , and the desires concerning the other things , entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful . <EOV> <SOV> ' And these are they who on the good ground have been sown : who do hear the word , and receive , and do bear fruit , one thirty - fold , and one sixty , and one an hundred . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Doth the lamp come that under the measure it may be put , or under the couch -- not that it may be put on the lamp - stand ? <EOV> <SOV> for there is not anything hid that may not be manifested , nor was anything kept hid but that it may come to light . <EOV> <SOV> If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Take heed what ye hear ; in what measure ye measure , it shall be measured to you ; and to you who hear it shall be added ; <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may have , there shall be given to him , and whoever hath not , also that which he hath shall be taken from him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' Thus is the reign of God : as if a man may cast the seed on the earth , <EOV> <SOV> and may sleep , and may rise night and day , and the seed spring up and grow , he hath not known how ; <EOV> <SOV> for of itself doth the earth bear fruit , first a blade , afterwards an ear , afterwards full corn in the ear ; <EOV> <SOV> and whenever the fruit may yield itself , immediately he doth send forth the sickle , because the harvest hath come . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said , ' To what may we liken the reign of God , or in what simile may we compare it ? <EOV> <SOV> As a grain of mustard , which , whenever it may be sown on the earth , is less than any of the seeds that are on the earth ; <EOV> <SOV> and whenever it may be sown , it cometh up , and doth become greater than any of the herbs , and doth make great branches , so that under its shade the fowls of the heaven are able to rest . ' <EOV> <SOV> And with many such similes he was speaking to them the word , as they were able to hear , <EOV> <SOV> and without a simile he was not speaking to them , and by themselves , to his disciples he was expounding all . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them on that day , evening having come , ' We may pass over to the other side ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having let away the multitude , they take him up as he was in the boat , and other little boats also were with him . <EOV> <SOV> And there cometh a great storm of wind , and the waves were beating on the boat , so that it is now being filled , <EOV> <SOV> and he himself was upon the stern , upon the pillow sleeping , and they wake him up , and say to him , ' Teacher , art thou not caring that we perish ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And having waked up , he rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , ' Peace , be stilled ; ' and the wind did lull , and there was a great calm : <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Why are ye so fearful ? how have ye not faith ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they feared a great fear , and said one to another , ' Who , then , is this , that even the wind and the sea do obey him ? ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And they came to the other side of the sea , to the region of the Gadarenes , <EOV> <SOV> and he having come forth out of the boat , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit , <EOV> <SOV> who had his dwelling in the tombs , and not even with chains was any one able to bind him , <EOV> <SOV> because that he many times with fetters and chains had been bound , and pulled in pieces by him had been the chains , and the fetters broken in pieces , and none was able to tame him , <EOV> <SOV> and always , night and day , in the mountains , and in the tombs he was , crying and cutting himself with stones . <EOV> <SOV> And , having seen Jesus from afar , he ran and bowed before him , <EOV> <SOV> and having called with a loud voice , he said , ' What -- to me and to thee , Jesus , Son of God the Most High ? I adjure thee by God , mayest thou not afflict me ! ' <EOV> <SOV> ( for he said to him , ' Come forth , spirit unclean , out of the man , ' ) <EOV> <SOV> and he was questioning him , ' What ' is ' thy name ? ' and he answered , saying , ' Legion ' is ' my name , because we are many ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he was calling on him much , that he may not send them out of the region . <EOV> <SOV> And there was there , near the mountains , a great herd of swine feeding , <EOV> <SOV> and all the demons did call upon him , saying , ' Send us to the swine , that into them we may enter ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately Jesus gave them leave , and having come forth , the unclean spirits did enter into the swine , and the herd did rush down the steep place to the sea -- and they were about two thousand -- and they were choked in the sea . <EOV> <SOV> And those feeding the swine did flee , and told in the city , and in the fields , and they came forth to see what it is that hath been done ; <EOV> <SOV> and they come unto Jesus , and see the demoniac , sitting , and clothed , and right - minded -- him having had the legion -- and they were afraid ; <EOV> <SOV> and those having seen ' it ' , declared to them how it had come to pass to the demoniac , and about the swine ; <EOV> <SOV> and they began to call upon him to go away from their borders . <EOV> <SOV> And he having gone into the boat , the demoniac was calling on him that he may be with him , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus did not suffer him , but saith to him , ' Go away to thy house , unto thine own ' friends ' , and tell them how great things the Lord did to thee , and dealt kindly with thee ; <EOV> <SOV> and he went away , and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus did to him , and all were wondering . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having passed over in the boat again to the other side , there was gathered a great multitude to him , and he was near the sea , <EOV> <SOV> and lo , there doth come one of the chiefs of the synagogue , by name Jairus , and having seen him , he doth fall at his feet , <EOV> <SOV> and he was calling upon him much , saying -- ' My little daughter is at the last extremity -- that having come , thou mayest lay on her ' thy ' hands , so that she may be saved , and she shall live ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he went away with him . And there was following him a great multitude , and they were thronging him , <EOV> <SOV> and a certain woman , having an issue of blood twelve years , <EOV> <SOV> and many things having suffered under many physicians , and having spent all that she had , and having profited nothing , but rather having come to the worse , <EOV> <SOV> having heard about Jesus , having come in the multitude behind , she touched his garment , <EOV> <SOV> for she said -- ' If even his garments I may touch , I shall be saved ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately was the fountain of her blood dried up , and she knew in the body that she hath been healed of the plague . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately Jesus having known in himself that out of him power had gone forth , having turned about in the multitude , said , ' Who did touch my garments ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and his disciples said to him , ' Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and thou sayest , ' Who did touch me ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was looking round to see her who did this , <EOV> <SOV> and the woman , having been afraid , and trembling , knowing what was done on her , came , and fell down before him , and told him all the truth , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to her , ' Daughter , thy faith hath saved thee ; go away in peace , and be whole from thy plague . ' <EOV> <SOV> As he is yet speaking , there come from the chief of the synagogue 's ' house , certain ' , saying -- ' Thy daughter did die , why still dost thou harass the Teacher ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus immediately , having heard the word that is spoken , saith to the chief of the synagogue , ' Be not afraid , only believe . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he did not suffer any one to follow with him , except Peter , and James , and John the brother of James ; <EOV> <SOV> and he cometh to the house of the chief of the synagogue , and seeth a tumult , much weeping and wailing ; <EOV> <SOV> and having gone in he saith to them , ' Why do ye make a tumult , and weep ? the child did not die , but doth sleep ; <EOV> <SOV> and they were laughing at him . And he , having put all forth , doth take the father of the child , and the mother , and those with him , and goeth in where the child is lying , <EOV> <SOV> and , having taken the hand of the child , he saith to her , ' Talitha cumi ; ' which is , being interpreted , ' Damsel ( I say to thee ) , arise . ' <EOV> <SOV> And immediately the damsel arose , and was walking , for she was twelve years ' old ' ; and they were amazed with a great amazement , <EOV> <SOV> and he charged them much , that no one may know this thing , and he said that there be given to her to eat . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he went forth thence , and came to his own country , and his disciples do follow him , <EOV> <SOV> and sabbath having come , he began in the synagogue to teach , and many hearing were astonished , saying , ' Whence hath this one these things ? and what the wisdom that was given to him , that also such mighty works through his hands are done ? <EOV> <SOV> Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , and Joses , and Judas , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? ' -- and they were being stumbled at him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to them -- ' A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his kindred , and in his own house ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he was not able there any mighty work to do , except on a few infirm people having put hands he did heal ' them ' ; <EOV> <SOV> and he wondered because of their unbelief . And he was going round the villages , in a circle , teaching , <EOV> <SOV> and he doth call near the twelve , and he began to send them forth two by two , and he was giving them power over the unclean spirits , <EOV> <SOV> and he commanded them that they may take nothing for the way , except a staff only -- no scrip , no bread , no brass in the girdle , <EOV> <SOV> but having been shod with sandals , and ye may not put on two coats . <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Whenever ye may enter into a house , there remain till ye may depart thence , <EOV> <SOV> and as many as may not receive you , nor hear you , going out thence , shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony to them ; verily I say to you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in a day of judgment than for that city . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having gone forth they were preaching that ' men ' might reform , <EOV> <SOV> and many demons they were casting out , and they were anointing with oil many infirm , and they were healing ' them ' . <EOV> <SOV> And the king Herod heard , ( for his name became public , ) and he said -- ' John the Baptist out of the dead was raised , and because of this the mighty powers are working in him . ' <EOV> <SOV> Others said -- ' It is Elijah , ' and others said -- ' It is a prophet , or as one of the prophets . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Herod having heard , said -- ' He whom I did behead -- John -- this is he ; he was raised out of the dead . ' <EOV> <SOV> For Herod himself , having sent forth , did lay hold on John , and bound him in the prison , because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother , because he married her , <EOV> <SOV> for John said to Herod -- ' It is not lawful to thee to have the wife of thy brother ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Herodias was having a quarrel with him , and was willing to kill him , and was not able , <EOV> <SOV> for Herod was fearing John , knowing him a man righteous and holy , and was keeping watch over him , and having heard him , was doing many things , and hearing him gladly . <EOV> <SOV> And a seasonable day having come , when Herod on his birthday was making a supper to his great men , and to the chiefs of thousands , and to the first men of Galilee , <EOV> <SOV> and the daughter of that Herodias having come in , and having danced , and having pleased Herod and those reclining ( at meat ) with him , the king said to the damsel , ' Ask of me whatever thou wilt , and I will give to thee , ' <EOV> <SOV> and he sware to her -- ' Whatever thou mayest ask me , I will give to thee -- unto the half of my kingdom . ' <EOV> <SOV> And she , having gone forth , said to her mother , ' What shall I ask for myself ? ' and she said , ' The head of John the Baptist ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having come in immediately with haste unto the king , she asked , saying , ' I will that thou mayest give me presently , upon a plate , the head of John the Baptist . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the king -- made very sorrowful -- because of the oaths and of those reclining ( at meat ) with him , would not put her away , <EOV> <SOV> and immediately the king having sent a guardsman , did command his head to be brought , <EOV> <SOV> and he having gone , beheaded him in the prison , and brought his head upon a plate , and did give it to the damsel , and the damsel did give it to her mother ; <EOV> <SOV> and having heard , his disciples came and took up his corpse , and laid it in the tomb . <EOV> <SOV> And the apostles are gathered together unto Jesus , and they told him all , and how many things they did , and how many things they taught , <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Come ye yourselves apart to a desert place , and rest a little , ' for those coming and those going were many , and not even to eat had they opportunity , <EOV> <SOV> and they went away to a desert place , in the boat , by themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitudes saw them going away , and many recognised him , and by land from all the cities they ran thither , and went before them , and came together to him , <EOV> <SOV> and having come forth , Jesus saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion on them , that they were as sheep not having a shepherd , and he began to teach many things . <EOV> <SOV> And now the hour being advanced , his disciples having come near to him , say , -- ' The place is desolate , and the hour is now advanced , <EOV> <SOV> let them away , that , having gone away to the surrounding fields and villages , they may buy to themselves loaves , for what they may eat they have not . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , ' Give ye them to eat , ' and they say to him , ' Having gone away , may we buy two hundred denaries ' worth of loaves , and give to them to eat ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , ' How many loaves have ye ? go and see ; ' and having known , they say , ' Five , and two fishes . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded them to make all recline in companies upon the green grass , <EOV> <SOV> and they sat down in squares , by hundreds , and by fifties . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes , having looked up to the heaven , he blessed , and brake the loaves , and was giving to his disciples , that they may set before them , and the two fishes divided he to all , <EOV> <SOV> and they did all eat , and were filled , <EOV> <SOV> and they took up of broken pieces twelve hand - baskets full , and of the fishes , <EOV> <SOV> and those eating of the loaves were about five thousand men . <EOV> <SOV> And immediately he constrained his disciples to go into the boat , and to go before to the other side , unto Bethsaida , till he may let the multitude away , <EOV> <SOV> and having taken leave of them , he went away to the mountain to pray . <EOV> <SOV> And evening having come , the boat was in the midst of the sea , and he alone upon the land ; <EOV> <SOV> and he saw them harassed in the rowing , for the wind was against them , and about the fourth watch of the night he doth come to them walking on the sea , and wished to pass by them . <EOV> <SOV> And they having seen him walking on the sea , thought ' it ' to be an apparition , and cried out , <EOV> <SOV> for they all saw him , and were troubled , and immediately he spake with them , and saith to them , ' Take courage , I am ' he ' , be not afraid . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he went up unto them to the boat , and the wind lulled , and greatly out of measure were they amazed in themselves , and were wondering , <EOV> <SOV> for they understood not concerning the loaves , for their heart hath been hard . <EOV> <SOV> And having passed over , they came upon the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore , <EOV> <SOV> and they having come forth out of the boat , immediately having recognised him , <EOV> <SOV> having run about through all that region round about , they began upon the couches to carry about those ill , where they were hearing that he is , <EOV> <SOV> and wherever he was going , to villages , or cities , or fields , in the market - places they were laying the infirm , and were calling upon him , that they may touch if it were but the fringe of his garment , and as many as were touching him were saved . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And gathered together unto him are the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , having come from Jerusalem , <EOV> <SOV> and having seen certain of his disciples with defiled hands -- that is , unwashed -- eating bread , they found fault ; <EOV> <SOV> for the Pharisees , and all the Jews , if they do not wash the hands to the wrist , do not eat , holding the tradition of the elders , <EOV> <SOV> and , ' coming ' from the market - place , if they do not baptize themselves , they do not eat ; and many other things there are that they received to hold , baptisms of cups , and pots , and brazen vessels , and couches . <EOV> <SOV> Then question him do the Pharisees and the scribes , ' Wherefore do thy disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders , but with unwashed hands do eat the bread ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said to them -- ' Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you , hypocrites , as it hath been written , This people with the lips doth honor Me , and their heart is far from Me ; <EOV> <SOV> and in vain do they worship Me , teaching teachings , commands of men ; <EOV> <SOV> for , having put away the command of God , ye hold the tradition of men , baptisms of pots and cups ; and many other such like things ye do . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Well do ye put away the command of God that your tradition ye may keep ; <EOV> <SOV> for Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye say , If a man may say to father or to mother , Korban ( that is , a gift ) , ' is ' whatever thou mayest be profited out of mine , <EOV> <SOV> and no more do ye suffer him to do anything for his father or for his mother , <EOV> <SOV> setting aside the word of God for your tradition that ye delivered ; and many such like things ye do . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having called near all the multitude , he said to them , ' Hearken to me , ye all , and understand ; <EOV> <SOV> there is nothing from without the man entering into him that is able to defile him , but the things coming out from him , those are the things defiling the man . <EOV> <SOV> If any hath ears to hear -- let him hear . ' <EOV> <SOV> And when he entered into a house from the multitude , his disciples were questioning him about the simile , <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' So also ye are without understanding ! Do ye not perceive that nothing from without entering into the man is able to defile him ? <EOV> <SOV> because it doth not enter into his heart , but into the belly , and into the drain it doth go out , purifying all the meats . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said -- ' That which is coming out from the man , that doth defile the man ; <EOV> <SOV> for from within , out of the heart of men , the evil reasonings do come forth , adulteries , whoredoms , murders , <EOV> <SOV> thefts , covetous desires , wickedness , deceit , arrogance , an evil eye , evil speaking , pride , foolishness ; <EOV> <SOV> all these evils do come forth from within , and they defile the man . ' <EOV> <SOV> And from thence having risen , he went away to the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and having entered into the house , he wished none to know , and he was not able to be hid , <EOV> <SOV> for a woman having heard about him , whose little daughter had an unclean spirit , having come , fell at his feet , -- <EOV> <SOV> and the woman was a Greek , a Syro - Phenician by nation -- and was asking him , that the demon he may cast forth out of her daughter . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to her , ' Suffer first the children to be filled , for it is not good to take the children 's bread , and to cast ' it ' to the little dogs . ' <EOV> <SOV> And she answered and saith to him , ' Yes , sir ; for the little dogs also under the table do eat of the children 's crumbs . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to her , ' Because of this word go ; the demon hath gone forth out of thy daughter ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having come away to her house , she found the demon gone forth , and the daughter laid upon the couch . <EOV> <SOV> And again , having gone forth from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis , <EOV> <SOV> and they bring to him a deaf , stuttering man , and they call on him that he may put the hand on him . <EOV> <SOV> And having taken him away from the multitude by himself , he put his fingers to his ears , and having spit , he touched his tongue , <EOV> <SOV> and having looked to the heaven , he sighed , and saith to him , ' Ephphatha , ' that is , ' Be thou opened ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately were his ears opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he was speaking plain . <EOV> <SOV> And he charged them that they may tell no one , but the more he was charging them , the more abundantly they were proclaiming ' it ' , <EOV> <SOV> and they were being beyond measure astonished , saying , ' Well hath he done all things ; both the deaf he doth make to hear , and the dumb to speak . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> In those days the multitude being very great , and not having what they may eat , Jesus having called near his disciples , saith to them , <EOV> <SOV> ' I have compassion upon the multitude , because now three days they do continue with me , and they have not what they may eat ; <EOV> <SOV> and if I shall let them away fasting to their home , they will faint in the way , for certain of them are come from far . ' <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples answered him , ' Whence shall any one be able these here to feed with bread in a wilderness ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he was questioning them , ' How many loaves have ye ? ' and they said , ' Seven . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground , and having taken the seven loaves , having given thanks , he brake , and was giving to his disciples that they may set before ' them ' ; and they did set before the multitude . <EOV> <SOV> And they had a few small fishes , and having blessed , he said to set them also before ' them ' ; <EOV> <SOV> and they did eat and were filled , and they took up that which was over of broken pieces -- seven baskets ; <EOV> <SOV> and those eating were about four thousand . And he let them away , <EOV> <SOV> and immediately having entered into the boat with his disciples , he came to the parts of Dalmanutha , <EOV> <SOV> and the Pharisees came forth , and began to dispute with him , seeking from him a sign from the heaven , tempting him ; <EOV> <SOV> and having sighed deeply in his spirit , he saith , ' Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? Verily I say to you , no sign shall be given to this generation . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having left them , having entered again into the boat , he went away to the other side ; <EOV> <SOV> and they forgot to take loaves , and except one loaf they had nothing with them in the boat , <EOV> <SOV> and he was charging them , saying , ' Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod , ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were reasoning with one another , saying -- ' Because we have no loaves . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having known , saith to them , ' Why do ye reason , because ye have no loaves ? do ye not yet perceive , nor understand , yet have ye your heart hardened ? <EOV> <SOV> Having eyes , do ye not see ? and having ears , do ye not hear ? and do ye not remember ? <EOV> <SOV> When the five loaves I did brake to the five thousand , how many hand - baskets full of broken pieces took ye up ? ' they say to him , ' Twelve . ' <EOV> <SOV> ' And when the seven to the four thousand , how many hand - baskets full of broken pieces took ye up ? ' and they said , ' Seven . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' How do ye not understand ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh to Bethsaida , and they bring to him one blind , and call upon him that he may touch him , <EOV> <SOV> and having taken the hand of the blind man , he led him forth without the village , and having spit on his eyes , having put ' his ' hands on him , he was questioning him if he doth behold anything : <EOV> <SOV> and he , having looked up , said , ' I behold men , as I see trees , walking . ' <EOV> <SOV> Afterwards again he put ' his ' hands on his eyes , and made him look up , and he was restored , and discerned all things clearly , <EOV> <SOV> and he sent him away to his house , saying , ' Neither to the village mayest thou go , nor tell ' it ' to any in the village . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus went forth , and his disciples , to the villages of Cesarea Philippi , and in the way he was questioning his disciples , saying to them , ' Who do men say me to be ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And they answered , ' John the Baptist , and others Elijah , but others one of the prophets . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , ' And ye -- who do ye say me to be ? ' and Peter answering saith to him , ' Thou art the Christ . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he strictly charged them that they may tell no one about it , <EOV> <SOV> and began to teach them , that it behoveth the Son of Man to suffer many things , and to be rejected by the elders , and chief priests , and scribes , and to be killed , and after three days to rise again ; <EOV> <SOV> and openly he was speaking the word . And Peter having taken him aside , began to rebuke him , <EOV> <SOV> and he , having turned , and having looked on his disciples , rebuked Peter , saying , ' Get behind me , Adversary , because thou dost not mind the things of God , but the things of men . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having called near the multitude , with his disciples , he said to them , ' Whoever doth will to come after me -- let him disown himself , and take up his cross , and follow me ; <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may will to save his life shall lose it ; and whoever may lose his life for my sake and for the good news ' sake , he shall save it ; <EOV> <SOV> for what shall it profit a man , if he may gain the whole world , and forfeit his life ? <EOV> <SOV> Or what shall a man give as an exchange for his life ? <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may be ashamed of me , and of my words , in this adulterous and sinful generation , the Son of Man also shall be ashamed of him , when he may come in the glory of his Father , with the holy messengers . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he said to them , ' Verily I say to you , That there are certain of those standing here , who may not taste of death till they see the reign of God having come in power . ' <EOV> <SOV> And after six days doth Jesus take Peter , and James , and John , and bringeth them up to a high mount by themselves , alone , and he was transfigured before them , <EOV> <SOV> and his garments became glittering , white exceedingly , as snow , so as a fuller upon the earth is not able to whiten ' them ' . <EOV> <SOV> And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses , and they were talking with Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter answering saith to Jesus , ' Rabbi , it is good to us to be here ; and we may make three booths , for thee one , and for Moses one , and for Elijah one : ' <EOV> <SOV> for he was not knowing what he might say , for they were greatly afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And there came a cloud overshadowing them , and there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , ' This is My Son -- the Beloved , hear ye him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and suddenly , having looked around , they saw no one any more , but Jesus only with themselves . <EOV> <SOV> And as they are coming down from the mount , he charged them that they may declare to no one the things that they saw , except when the Son of Man may rise out of the dead ; <EOV> <SOV> and the thing they kept to themselves , questioning together what the rising out of the dead is . <EOV> <SOV> And they were questioning him , saying , that the scribes say that Elijah it behoveth to come first . <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , ' Elijah indeed , having come first , doth restore all things ; and how hath it been written concerning the Son of Man , that many things he may suffer , and be set at nought ? <EOV> <SOV> But I say to you , That also Elijah hath come , and they did to him what they willed , as it hath been written of him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having come unto the disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and scribes questioning with them , <EOV> <SOV> and immediately , all the multitude having seen him , were amazed , and running near , were saluting him . <EOV> <SOV> And he questioned the scribes , ' What dispute ye with them ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and one out of the multitude answering said , ' Teacher , I brought my son unto thee , having a dumb spirit ; <EOV> <SOV> and wherever it doth seize him , it doth tear him , and he foameth , and gnasheth his teeth , and pineth away ; and I spake to thy disciples that they may cast it out , and they were not able . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering him , said , ' O generation unbelieving , till when shall I be with you ? till when shall I suffer you ? bring him unto me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they brought him unto him , and he having seen him , immediately the spirit tare him , and he , having fallen upon the earth , was wallowing -- foaming . <EOV> <SOV> And he questioned his father , ' How long time is it since this came to him ? ' and he said , ' From childhood , <EOV> <SOV> and many times also it cast him into fire , and into water , that it might destroy him ; but if thou art able to do anything , help us , having compassion on us . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , ' If thou art able to believe ! all things are possible to the one that is believing ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and immediately the father of the child , having cried out , with tears said , ' I believe , sir ; be helping mine unbelief . ' <EOV> <SOV> Jesus having seen that a multitude doth run together , rebuked the unclean spirit , saying to it , ' Spirit -- dumb and deaf -- I charge thee , come forth out of him , and no more thou mayest enter into him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having cried , and rent him much , it came forth , and he became as dead , so that many said that he was dead , <EOV> <SOV> but Jesus , having taken him by the hand , lifted him up , and he arose . <EOV> <SOV> And he having come into the house , his disciples were questioning him by himself -- ' Why were we not able to cast it forth ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he said to them , ' This kind is able to come forth with nothing except with prayer and fasting . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having gone forth thence , they were passing through Galilee , and he did not wish that any may know , <EOV> <SOV> for he was teaching his disciples , and he said to them , ' The Son of Man is being delivered to the hands of men , and they shall kill him , and having been killed the third day he shall rise , ' <EOV> <SOV> but they were not understanding the saying , and they were afraid to question him . <EOV> <SOV> And he came to Capernaum , and being in the house , he was questioning them , ' What were ye reasoning in the way among yourselves ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were silent , for with one another they did reason in the way who is greater ; <EOV> <SOV> and having sat down he called the twelve , and he saith to them , ' If any doth will to be first , he shall be last of all , and minister of all . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having taken a child , he set him in the midst of them , and having taken him in his arms , said to them , <EOV> <SOV> ' Whoever may receive one of such children in my name , doth receive me , and whoever may receive me , doth not receive me , but Him who sent me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And John did answer him , saying , ' Teacher , we saw a certain one in thy name casting out demons , who doth not follow us , and we forbade him , because he doth not follow us . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' Forbid him not , for there is no one who shall do a mighty work in my name , and shall be able readily to speak evil of me : <EOV> <SOV> for he who is not against us is for us ; <EOV> <SOV> for whoever may give you to drink a cup of water in my name , because ye are Christ 's , verily I say to you , he may not lose his reward ; <EOV> <SOV> and whoever may cause to stumble one of the little ones believing in me , better is it for him if a millstone is hanged about his neck , and he hath been cast into the sea . <EOV> <SOV> ' And if thy hand may cause thee to stumble , cut it off ; it is better for thee maimed to enter into the life , than having the two hands , to go away to the gehenna , to the fire -- the unquenchable -- <EOV> <SOV> where there worm is not dying , and the fire is not being quenched . <EOV> <SOV> ' And if thy foot may cause thee to stumble , cut it off ; it is better for thee to enter into the life lame , than having the two feet to be cast to the gehenna , to the fire -- the unquenchable -- <EOV> <SOV> where there worm is not dying , and the fire is not being quenched . <EOV> <SOV> And if thine eye may cause thee to stumble , cast it out ; it is better for thee one - eyed to enter into the reign of God , than having two eyes , to be cast to the gehenna of the fire -- <EOV> <SOV> where their worm is not dying , and the fire is not being quenched ; <EOV> <SOV> for every one with fire shall be salted , and every sacrifice with salt shall be salted . <EOV> <SOV> The salt ' is ' good , but if the salt may become saltless , in what will ye season ' it ' ? Have in yourselves salt , and have peace in one another . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And having risen thence , he doth come to the coasts of Judea , through the other side of the Jordan , and again do multitudes come together unto him , and , as he had been accustomed , again he was teaching them . <EOV> <SOV> And the Pharisees , having come near , questioned him , if it is lawful for a husband to put away a wife , tempting him , <EOV> <SOV> and he answering said to them , ' What did Moses command you ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said , ' Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce , and to put away . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' For the stiffness of your heart he wrote you this command , <EOV> <SOV> but from the beginning of the creation , a male and a female God did make them ; <EOV> <SOV> on this account shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall cleave unto his wife , <EOV> <SOV> and they shall be -- the two -- for one flesh ; so that they are no more two , but one flesh ; <EOV> <SOV> what therefore God did join together , let not man put asunder . ' <EOV> <SOV> And in the house again his disciples of the same thing questioned him , <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' Whoever may put away his wife , and may marry another , doth commit adultery against her ; <EOV> <SOV> and if a woman may put away her husband , and is married to another , she committeth adultery . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were bringing to him children , that he might touch them , and the disciples were rebuking those bringing them , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus having seen , was much displeased , and he said to them , ' Suffer the children to come unto me , and forbid them not , for of such is the reign of God ; <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to you , whoever may not receive the reign of God , as a child -- he may not enter into it ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and having taken them in his arms , having put ' his ' hands upon them , he was blessing them . <EOV> <SOV> And as he is going forth into the way , one having run and having kneeled to him , was questioning him , ' Good teacher , what may I do , that life age - during I may inherit ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , ' Why me dost thou call good ? no one ' is ' good except One -- God ; <EOV> <SOV> the commands thou hast known : Thou mayest not commit adultery , Thou mayest do no murder , Thou mayest not steal , Thou mayest not bear false witness , Thou mayest not defraud , Honour thy father and mother . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to him , ' Teacher , all these did I keep from my youth . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having looked upon him , did love him , and said to him , ' One thing thou dost lack ; go away , whatever thou hast -- sell , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven , and come , be following me , having taken up the cross . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he -- gloomy at the word -- went away sorrowing , for he was having many possessions . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having looked round , saith to his disciples , ' How hardly shall they who have riches enter into the reign of God ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And the disciples were astonished at his words , and Jesus again answering saith to them , ' Children , how hard is it to those trusting on the riches to enter into the reign of God ! <EOV> <SOV> It is easier for a camel through the eye of the needle to enter , than for a rich man to enter into the reign of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were astonished beyond measure , saying unto themselves , ' And who is able to be saved ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having looked upon them , saith , ' With men it is impossible , but not with God ; for all things are possible with God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter began to say to him , ' Lo , we left all , and we followed thee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , ' Verily I say to you , there is no one who left house , or brothers , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or fields , for my sake , and for the good news ' , <EOV> <SOV> who may not receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brothers , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and fields , with persecutions , and in the age that is coming , life age - during ; <EOV> <SOV> and many first shall be last , and the last first . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus was going before them , and they were amazed , and following they were afraid . And having again taken the twelve , he began to tell them the things about to happen to him , <EOV> <SOV> -- ' Lo , we go up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests , and to the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the nations , <EOV> <SOV> and they shall mock him , and scourge him , and spit on him , and kill him , and the third day he shall rise again . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there come near to him James and John , the sons of Zebedee , saying , ' Teacher , we wish that whatever we may ask for ourselves , thou mayest do for us ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' What do ye wish me to do for you ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said to him , ' Grant to us that , one on thy right hand and one on thy left , we may sit in thy glory ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to them , ' Ye have not known what ye ask ; are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink of , and with the baptism that I am baptized with -- to be baptized ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And they said to him , ' We are able ; ' and Jesus said to them , ' Of the cup indeed that I drink of , ye shall drink , and with the baptism that I am baptized with , ye shall be baptized ; <EOV> <SOV> but to sit on my right and on my left , is not mine to give , but -- to those for whom it hath been prepared . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the ten having heard , began to be much displeased at James and John , <EOV> <SOV> but Jesus having called them near , saith to them , ' Ye have known that they who are considered to rule the nations do exercise lordship over them , and their great ones do exercise authority upon them ; <EOV> <SOV> but not so shall it be among you ; but whoever may will to become great among you , he shall be your minister , <EOV> <SOV> and whoever of you may will to become first , he shall be servant of all ; <EOV> <SOV> for even the Son of Man came not to be ministered to , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jericho , and as he is going forth from Jericho , with his disciples and a great multitude , a son of Timaeus -- Bartimaeus the blind -- was sitting beside the way begging , <EOV> <SOV> and having heard that it is Jesus the Nazarene , he began to cry out , and to say , ' The Son of David -- Jesus ! deal kindly with me ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and many were rebuking him , that he might keep silent , but the more abundantly he cried out , ' Son of David , deal kindly with me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having stood , he commanded him to be called , and they call the blind man , saying to him , ' Take courage , rise , he doth call thee ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he , having cast away his garment , having risen , did come unto Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And answering , Jesus saith to him , ' What wilt thou I may do to thee ? ' and the blind man said to him , ' Rabboni , that I may see again ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said to him , ' Go , thy faith hath saved thee : ' and immediately he saw again , and was following Jesus in the way . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And when they come nigh to Jerusalem , to Bethphage , and Bethany , unto the mount of the Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples , <EOV> <SOV> and saith to them , ' Go away to the village that is over - against you , and immediately , entering into it , ye shall find a colt tied , on which no one of men hath sat , having loosed it , bring ' it ' : <EOV> <SOV> and if any one may say to you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the lord hath need of it , and immediately he will send it hither . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they went away , and found the colt tied at the door without , by the two ways , and they loose it , <EOV> <SOV> and certain of those standing there said to them , ' What do ye -- loosing the colt ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they said to them as Jesus commanded , and they suffered them . <EOV> <SOV> And they brought the colt unto Jesus , and did cast upon it their garments , and he sat upon it , <EOV> <SOV> and many did spread their garments in the way , and others were cutting down branches from the trees , and were strewing in the way . <EOV> <SOV> And those going before and those following were crying out , saying , ' Hosanna ! blessed ' is ' he who is coming in the name of the Lord ; <EOV> <SOV> blessed is the coming reign , in the name of the Lord , of our father David ; Hosanna in the highest . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple , and having looked round on all things , it being now evening , he went forth to Bethany with the twelve . <EOV> <SOV> And on the morrow , they having come forth from Bethany , he hungered , <EOV> <SOV> and having seen a fig - tree afar off having leaves , he came , if perhaps he shall find anything in it , and having come to it , he found nothing except leaves , for it was not a time of figs , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus answering said to it , ' No more from thee -- to the age -- may any eat fruit ; ' and his disciples were hearing . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to Jerusalem , and Jesus having gone into the temple , began to cast forth those selling and buying in the temple , and the tables of the money - changers and the seats of those selling the doves , he overthrew , <EOV> <SOV> and he did not suffer that any might bear a vessel through the temple , <EOV> <SOV> and he was teaching , saying to them , ' Hath it not been written -- My house a house of prayer shall be called for all the nations , and ye did make it a den of robbers ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And the scribes and the chief priests heard , and they were seeking how they shall destroy him , for they were afraid of him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching ; <EOV> <SOV> and when evening came , he was going forth without the city . <EOV> <SOV> And in the morning , passing by , they saw the fig - tree having been dried up from the roots , <EOV> <SOV> and Peter having remembered saith to him , ' Rabbi , lo , the fig - tree that thou didst curse is dried up . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering saith to them , ' Have faith of God ; <EOV> <SOV> for verily I say to you , that whoever may say to this mount , Be taken up , and be cast into the sea , and may not doubt in his heart , but may believe that the things that he saith do come to pass , it shall be to him whatever he may say . <EOV> <SOV> Because of this I say to you , all whatever -- praying -- ye do ask , believe that ye receive , and it shall be to you . <EOV> <SOV> ' And whenever ye may stand praying , forgive , if ye have anything against any one , that your Father also who is in the heavens may forgive you your trespasses ; <EOV> <SOV> and , if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your trespasses . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they come again to Jerusalem , and in the temple , as he is walking , there come unto him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders , <EOV> <SOV> and they say to him , ' By what authority dost thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority that these things thou mayest do ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' I will question you -- I also -- one word ; and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things ; <EOV> <SOV> the baptism of John -- from heaven was it ? or from men ? answer me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were reasoning with themselves , saying , ' If we may say , From heaven , he will say , Wherefore , then , did ye not believe him ? <EOV> <SOV> But if we may say , From men , ' -- they were fearing the people , for all were holding John that he was indeed a prophet ; <EOV> <SOV> and answering they say to Jesus , ' We have not known ; ' and Jesus answering saith to them , ' Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And he began to speak to them in similes : ' A man planted a vineyard , and put a hedge around , and digged an under - winevat , and built a tower , and gave it out to husbandmen , and went abroad ; <EOV> <SOV> and he sent unto the husbandmen at the due time a servant , that from the husbandmen he may receive from the fruit of the vineyard , <EOV> <SOV> and they , having taken him , did severely beat ' him ' , and did send him away empty . <EOV> <SOV> ' And again he sent unto them another servant , and at that one having cast stones , they wounded ' him ' in the head , and sent away -- dishonoured . <EOV> <SOV> ' And again he sent another , and that one they killed ; and many others , some beating , and some killing . <EOV> <SOV> ' Having yet therefore one son -- his beloved -- he sent also him unto them last , saying -- They will reverence my son ; <EOV> <SOV> and those husbandmen said among themselves -- This is the heir , come , we may kill him , and ours shall be the inheritance ; <EOV> <SOV> and having taken him , they did kill , and cast ' him ' forth without the vineyard . <EOV> <SOV> ' What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard to others . <EOV> <SOV> And this Writing did ye not read : A stone that the builders rejected , it did become the head of a corner : <EOV> <SOV> from the Lord was this , and it is wonderful in our eyes . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were seeking to lay hold on him , and they feared the multitude , for they knew that against them he spake the simile , and having left him , they went away ; <EOV> <SOV> and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , that they may ensnare him in discourse , <EOV> <SOV> and they having come , say to him , ' Teacher , we have known that thou art true , and thou art not caring for any one , for thou dost not look to the face of men , but in truth the way of God dost teach ; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not ? may we give , or may we not give ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , knowing their hypocrisy , said to them , ' Why me do ye tempt ? bring me a denary , that I may see ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they brought , and he saith to them , ' Whose ' is ' this image , and the inscription ? ' and they said to him , ' Caesar 's ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus answering said to them , ' Give back the things of Caesar to Caesar , and the things of God to God ; ' and they did wonder at him . <EOV> <SOV> And the Sadducees come unto him , who say there is not a rising again , and they questioned him , saying , <EOV> <SOV> ' Teacher , Moses wrote to us , that if any one 's brother may die , and may leave a wife , and may leave no children , that his brother may take his wife , and raise up seed to his brother . <EOV> <SOV> ' There were then seven brothers , and the first took a wife , and dying , he left no seed ; <EOV> <SOV> and the second took her , and died , neither left he seed , and the third in like manner , <EOV> <SOV> and the seven took her , and left no seed , last of all died also the woman ; <EOV> <SOV> in the rising again , then , whenever they may rise , of which of them shall she be wife -- for the seven had her as wife ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' Do ye not because of this go astray , not knowing the Writings , nor the power of God ? <EOV> <SOV> for when they may rise out of the dead , they neither marry nor are they given in marriage , but are as messengers who are in the heavens . <EOV> <SOV> ' And concerning the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the Book of Moses ( at The Bush ) , how God spake to him , saying , I ' am ' the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ; <EOV> <SOV> he is not the God of dead men , but a God of living men ; ye then go greatly astray . ' <EOV> <SOV> And one of the scribes having come near , having heard them disputing , knowing that he answered them well , questioned him , ' Which is the first command of all ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus answered him -- ' The first of all the commands ' is ' , Hear , O Israel , the Lord is our God , the Lord is one ; <EOV> <SOV> and thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart , and out of thy soul , and out of all thine understanding , and out of all thy strength -- this ' is ' the first command ; <EOV> <SOV> and the second ' is ' like ' it ' , this , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ; -- greater than these there is no other command . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the scribe said to him , ' Well , Teacher , in truth thou hast spoken that there is one God , and there is none other but He ; <EOV> <SOV> and to love Him out of all the heart , and out of all the understanding , and out of all the soul , and out of all the strength , and to love one 's neighbor as one 's self , is more than all the whole burnt - offerings and the sacrifices . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus , having seen him that he answered with understanding , said to him , ' Thou art not far from the reign of God ; ' and no one any more durst question him . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said , teaching in the temple , ' How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David ? <EOV> <SOV> for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , The Lord said to my lord , Sit thou on My right hand , till I place thine enemies -- thy footstool ; <EOV> <SOV> therefore David himself saith of him Lord , and whence is he his son ? ' And the great multitude were hearing him gladly , <EOV> <SOV> and he was saying to them in his teaching , ' Beware of the scribes , who will in long robes to walk , and love salutations in the market - places , <EOV> <SOV> and first seats in the synagogues , and first couches in suppers , <EOV> <SOV> who are devouring the widows ' houses , and for a pretense are making long prayers ; these shall receive more abundant judgment . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having sat down over - against the treasury , was beholding how the multitude do put brass into the treasury , and many rich were putting in much , <EOV> <SOV> and having come , a poor widow did put in two mites , which are a farthing . <EOV> <SOV> And having called near his disciples , he saith to them , ' Verily I say to you , that this poor widow hath put in more than all those putting into the treasury ; <EOV> <SOV> for all , out of their abundance , put in , but she , out of her want , all that she had put in -- all her living . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And as he is going forth out of the temple , one of his disciples saith to him , ' Teacher , see ! what stones ! and what buildings ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus answering said to him , ' Seest thou these great buildings ? there may not be left a stone upon a stone , that may not be thrown down . ' <EOV> <SOV> And as he is sitting at the mount of the Olives , over - against the temple , Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , were questioning him by himself , <EOV> <SOV> ' Tell us when these things shall be ? and what ' is ' the sign when all these may be about to be fulfilled ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering them , began to say , ' Take heed lest any one may lead you astray , <EOV> <SOV> for many shall come in my name , saying -- I am ' he ' , and many they shall lead astray ; <EOV> <SOV> and when ye may hear of wars and reports of wars , be not troubled , for these behove to be , but the end ' is ' not yet ; <EOV> <SOV> for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom , and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles ; beginnings of sorrows ' are ' these . <EOV> <SOV> ' And take ye heed to yourselves , for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims , and to synagogues , ye shall be beaten , and before governors and kings ye shall be set for my sake , for a testimony to them ; <EOV> <SOV> and to all the nations it behoveth first that the good news be proclaimed . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when they may lead you , delivering up , be not anxious beforehand what ye may speak , nor premeditate , but whatever may be given to you in that hour , that speak ye , for it is not ye who are speaking , but the Holy Spirit . <EOV> <SOV> ' And brother shall deliver up brother to death , and father child , and children shall rise up against parents , and shall put them to death , <EOV> <SOV> and ye shall be hated by all because of my name , but he who hath endured to the end -- he shall be saved . <EOV> <SOV> ' And when ye may see the abomination of the desolation , that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( whoever is reading let him understand ) , then those in Judea , let them flee to the mountains ; <EOV> <SOV> and he upon the house - top , let him not come down to the house , nor come in to take anything out of his house ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who is in the field , let him not turn to the things behind , to take up his garment . <EOV> <SOV> ' And wo to those with child , and to those giving suck , in those days ; <EOV> <SOV> and pray ye that your flight may not be in winter , <EOV> <SOV> for those days shall be tribulation , such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation that God created , till now , and may not be ; <EOV> <SOV> and if the Lord did not shorten the days , no flesh had been saved ; but because of the chosen , whom He did choose to Himself , He did shorten the days . <EOV> <SOV> ' And then , if any may say to you , Lo , here ' is ' the Christ , or , Lo , there , ye may not believe ; <EOV> <SOV> for there shall rise false Christs and false prophets , and they shall give signs and wonders , to seduce , if possible , also the chosen ; <EOV> <SOV> and ye , take heed ; lo , I have foretold you all things . <EOV> <SOV> ' But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , <EOV> <SOV> and the stars of the heaven shall be falling , and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken . <EOV> <SOV> ' And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds with much power and glory , <EOV> <SOV> and then he shall send his messengers , and gather together his chosen from the four winds , from the end of the earth unto the end of heaven . <EOV> <SOV> ' And from the fig - tree learn ye the simile : when the branch may already become tender , and may put forth the leaves , ye know that nigh is the summer ; <EOV> <SOV> so ye , also , when these ye may see coming to pass , ye know that it is nigh , at the doors . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , that this generation may not pass away till all these things may come to pass ; <EOV> <SOV> the heaven and the earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away . <EOV> <SOV> ' And concerning that day and the hour no one hath known -- not even the messengers who are in the heaven , not even the Son -- except the Father . <EOV> <SOV> Take heed , watch and pray , for ye have not known when the time is ; <EOV> <SOV> as a man who is gone abroad , having left his house , and given to his servants the authority , and to each one his work , did command also the porter that he may watch ; <EOV> <SOV> watch ye , therefore , for ye have not known when the lord of the house doth come , at even , or at midnight , or at cock - crowing , or at the morning ; <EOV> <SOV> lest , having come suddenly , he may find you sleeping ; <EOV> <SOV> and what I say to you , I say to all , Watch . ' <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the passover and the unleavened food were after two days , and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how , by guile , having taken hold of him , they might kill him ; <EOV> <SOV> and they said , ' Not in the feast , lest there shall be a tumult of the people . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he , being in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper , at his reclining ( at meat ) , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment , of spikenard , very precious , and having broken the alabaster box , did pour on his head ; <EOV> <SOV> and there were certain much displeased within themselves , and saying , ' For what hath this waste of the ointment been made ? <EOV> <SOV> for this could have been sold for more than three hundred denaries , and given to the poor ; ' and they were murmuring at her . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said , ' Let her alone ; why are ye giving her trouble ? a good work she wrought on me ; <EOV> <SOV> for the poor always ye have with you , and whenever ye may will ye are able to do them good , but me ye have not always ; <EOV> <SOV> what she could she did , she anticipated to anoint my body for the embalming . <EOV> <SOV> Verily I say to you , wherever this good news may be proclaimed in the whole world , what also this woman did shall be spoken of -- for a memorial of her . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Judas the Iscariot , one of the twelve , went away unto the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them , <EOV> <SOV> and having heard , they were glad , and promised to give him money , and he was seeking how , conveniently , he might deliver him up . <EOV> <SOV> And the first day of the unleavened food , when they were killing the passover , his disciples say to him , ' Where wilt thou , ' that , ' having gone , we may prepare , that thou mayest eat the passover ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith to them , ' Go ye away to the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water , follow him ; <EOV> <SOV> and wherever he may go in , say ye to the master of the house -- The Teacher saith , Where is the guest - chamber , where the passover , with my disciples , I may eat ? <EOV> <SOV> and he will shew you a large upper room , furnished , prepared -- there make ready for us . ' <EOV> <SOV> And his disciples went forth , and came to the city , and found as he said to them , and they made ready the passover . <EOV> <SOV> And evening having come , he cometh with the twelve , <EOV> <SOV> and as they are reclining , and eating , Jesus said , ' Verily I say to you -- one of you , who is eating with me -- shall deliver me up . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they began to be sorrowful , and to say to him , one by one , ' Is it I ? ' and another , ' Is it I ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And he answering said to them , ' One of the twelve who is dipping with me in the dish ; <EOV> <SOV> the Son of Man doth indeed go , as it hath been written concerning him , but wo to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up ; good were it to him if that man had not been born . ' <EOV> <SOV> And as they are eating , Jesus having taken bread , having blessed , brake , and gave to them , and said , ' Take , eat ; this is my body . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having taken the cup , having given thanks , he gave to them , and they drank of it -- all ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' This is my blood of the new covenant , which for many is being poured out ; <EOV> <SOV> verily I say to you , that no more may I drink of the produce of the vine till that day when I may drink it new in the reign of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having sung an hymn , they went forth to the mount of the Olives , <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus saith to them -- ' All ye shall be stumbled at me this night , because it hath been written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered abroad , <EOV> <SOV> but after my having risen I will go before you to Galilee . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Peter said to him , ' And if all shall be stumbled , yet not I ; ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus said to him , ' Verily I say to thee , that to - day , this night , before a cock shall crow twice , thrice thou shalt deny me . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he spake the more vehemently , ' If it may be necessary for me to die with thee -- I will in nowise deny thee ; ' and in like manner also said they all . <EOV> <SOV> And they come to a spot , the name of which ' is ' Gethsemane , and he saith to his disciples , ' Sit ye here till I may pray ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he taketh Peter , and James , and John with him , and began to be amazed , and to be very heavy , <EOV> <SOV> and he saith to them , ' Exceeding sorrowful is my soul -- to death ; remain here , and watch . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having gone forward a little , he fell upon the earth , and was praying , that , if it be possible the hour may pass from him , <EOV> <SOV> and he said , ' Abba , Father ; all things are possible to Thee ; make this cup pass from me ; but , not what I will , but what Thou . ' <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith to Peter , ' Simon , thou dost sleep ! thou wast not able to watch one hour ! <EOV> <SOV> Watch ye and pray , that ye may not enter into temptation ; the spirit indeed is forward , but the flesh weak . ' <EOV> <SOV> And again having gone away , he prayed , the same word saying ; <EOV> <SOV> and having returned , he found them again sleeping , for their eyes were heavy , and they had not known what they might answer him . <EOV> <SOV> And he cometh the third time , and saith to them , ' Sleep on henceforth , and rest -- it is over ; the hour did come ; lo , the Son of Man is delivered up to the hands of the sinful ; <EOV> <SOV> rise , we may go , lo , he who is delivering me up hath come nigh . ' <EOV> <SOV> And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- cometh near Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude , with swords and sticks , from the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ; <EOV> <SOV> and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them , saying , ' Whomsoever I shall kiss , he it is , lay hold on him , and lead him away safely , ' <EOV> <SOV> and having come , immediately , having gone near him , he saith , ' Rabbi , Rabbi , ' and kissed him . <EOV> <SOV> And they laid on him their hands , and kept hold on him ; <EOV> <SOV> and a certain one of those standing by , having drawn the sword , struck the servant of the chief priest , and took off his ear . <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus answering said to them , ' As against a robber ye came out , with swords and sticks , to take me ! <EOV> <SOV> daily I was with you in the temple teaching , and ye did not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled . ' <EOV> <SOV> And having left him they all fled ; <EOV> <SOV> and a certain young man was following him , having put a linen cloth about ' his ' naked body , and the young men lay hold on him , <EOV> <SOV> and he , having left the linen cloth , did flee from them naked . <EOV> <SOV> And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest , and come together to him do all the chief priests , and the elders , and the scribes ; <EOV> <SOV> and Peter afar off did follow him , to the inside of the hall of the chief priest , and he was sitting with the officers , and warming himself near the fire . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests and all the sanhedrim were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death , and they were not finding , <EOV> <SOV> for many were bearing false testimony against him , and their testimonies were not alike . <EOV> <SOV> And certain having risen up , were bearing false testimony against him , saying -- <EOV> <SOV> ' We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands , and by three days , another made without hands I will build ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and neither so was their testimony alike . <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priest , having risen up in the midst , questioned Jesus , saying , ' Thou dost not answer anything ! what do these testify against thee ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and he was keeping silent , and did not answer anything . Again the chief priest was questioning him , and saith to him , ' Art thou the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus said , ' I am ; and ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power , and coming with the clouds , of the heaven . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priest , having rent his garments , saith , ' What need have we yet of witnesses ? <EOV> <SOV> Ye heard the evil speaking , what appeareth to you ? ' and they all condemned him to be worthy of death , <EOV> <SOV> and certain began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say to him , ' Prophesy ; ' and the officers were striking him with their palms . <EOV> <SOV> And Peter being in the hall beneath , there doth come one of the maids of the chief priest , <EOV> <SOV> and having seen Peter warming himself , having looked on him , she said , ' And thou wast with Jesus of Nazareth ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and he denied , saying , ' I have not known ' him ' , neither do I understand what thou sayest ; ' and he went forth without to the porch , and a cock crew . <EOV> <SOV> And the maid having seen him again , began to say to those standing near -- ' This is of them ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he was again denying . And after a little again , those standing near said to Peter , ' Truly thou art of them , for thou also art a Galilean , and thy speech is alike ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and he began to anathematize , and to swear -- ' I have not known this man of whom ye speak ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and a second time a cock crew , and Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him -- ' Before a cock crow twice , thou mayest deny me thrice ; ' and having thought thereon -- he was weeping . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And immediately , in the morning , the chief priests having made a consultation , with the elders , and scribes , and the whole sanhedrim , having bound Jesus , did lead away , and delivered ' him ' to Pilate ; <EOV> <SOV> and Pilate questioned him , ' Art thou the king of the Jews ? ' and he answering said to him , ' Thou dost say ' it ' . ' <EOV> <SOV> And the chief priests were accusing him of many things , ' but he answered nothing . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate again questioned him , saying , ' Thou dost not answer anything ! lo , how many things they do testify against thee ! ' <EOV> <SOV> and Jesus did no more answer anything , so that Pilate wondered . <EOV> <SOV> And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner , whomsoever they were asking ; <EOV> <SOV> and there was ' one ' named Barabbas , bound with those making insurrection with him , who had in the insurrection committed murder . <EOV> <SOV> And the multitude having cried out , began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them , <EOV> <SOV> and Pilate answered them , saying , ' Will ye ' that ' I shall release to you the king of the Jews ? ' <EOV> <SOV> for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up ; <EOV> <SOV> and the chief priests did move the multitude , that he might rather release Barabbas to them . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate answering , again said to them , ' What , then , will ye ' that ' I shall do to him whom ye call king of the Jews ? ' <EOV> <SOV> and they again cried out , ' Crucify him . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate said to them , ' Why -- what evil did he ? ' and they cried out the more vehemently , ' Crucify him ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and Pilate , wishing to content the multitude , released to them Barabbas , and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged ' him ' -- that he might be crucified . <EOV> <SOV> And the soldiers led him away into the hall , which is Praetorium , and call together the whole band , <EOV> <SOV> and clothe him with purple , and having plaited a crown of thorns , they put ' it ' on him , <EOV> <SOV> and began to salute him , ' Hail , King of the Jews . ' <EOV> <SOV> And they were smiting him on the head with a reed , and were spitting on him , and having bent the knee , were bowing to him , <EOV> <SOV> and when they ' had ' mocked him , they took the purple from off him , and clothed him in his own garments , and they led him forth , that they may crucify him . <EOV> <SOV> And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon , a Cyrenian , coming from the field , the father of Alexander and Rufus -- that he may bear his cross , <EOV> <SOV> and they bring him to the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , ' Place of a skull ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh , and he did not receive . <EOV> <SOV> And having crucified him , they were dividing his garments , casting a lot upon them , what each may take ; <EOV> <SOV> and it was the third hour , and they crucified him ; <EOV> <SOV> and the inscription of his accusation was written above -- ' The King of the Jews . ' <EOV> <SOV> And with him they crucify two robbers , one on the right hand , and one on his left , <EOV> <SOV> and the Writing was fulfilled that is saying , ' And with lawless ones he was numbered . ' <EOV> <SOV> And those passing by were speaking evil of him , shaking their heads , and saying , ' Ah , the thrower down of the sanctuary , and in three days the builder ! <EOV> <SOV> save thyself , and come down from the cross ! ' <EOV> <SOV> And in like manner also the chief priests , mocking with one another , with the scribes , said , ' Others he saved ; himself he is not able to save . <EOV> <SOV> The Christ ! the king of Israel -- let him come down now from the cross , that we may see and believe ; ' and those crucified with him were reproaching him . <EOV> <SOV> And the sixth hour having come , darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour , <EOV> <SOV> and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice , saying , ' Eloi , Eloi , lamma sabachthani ? ' which is , being interpreted , ' My God , my God , why didst Thou forsake me ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And certain of those standing by , having heard , said , ' Lo , Elijah he doth call ; ' <EOV> <SOV> and one having run , and having filled a spunge with vinegar , having put ' it ' also on a reed , was giving him to drink , saying , ' Let alone , let us see if Elijah doth come to take him down . ' <EOV> <SOV> And Jesus having uttered a loud cry , yielded the spirit , <EOV> <SOV> and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two , from top to bottom , <EOV> <SOV> and the centurion who was standing over - against him , having seen that , having so cried out , he yielded the spirit , said , ' Truly this man was Son of God . ' <EOV> <SOV> And there were also women afar off beholding , among whom was also Mary the Magdalene , and Mary of James the less , and of Joses , and Salome , <EOV> <SOV> ( who also , when he was in Galilee , were following him , and were ministering to him , ) and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem . <EOV> <SOV> And now evening having come , seeing it was the preparation , that is , the fore - sabbath , <EOV> <SOV> Joseph of Arimathea , an honourable counsellor , who also himself was waiting for the reign of God , came , boldly entered in unto Pilate , and asked the body of Jesus . <EOV> <SOV> And Pilate wondered if he were already dead , and having called near the centurion , did question him if he were long dead , <EOV> <SOV> and having known ' it ' from the centurion , he granted the body to Joseph . <EOV> <SOV> And he , having brought fine linen , and having taken him down , wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock , and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre , <EOV> <SOV> and Mary the Magdalene , and Mary of Joses , were beholding where he is laid . <EOV> <EOC> <SOC> <SOV> And the sabbath having past , Mary the Magdalene , and Mary of James , and Salome , bought spices , that having come , they may anoint him , <EOV> <SOV> and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths , they come unto the sepulchre , at the rising of the sun , <EOV> <SOV> and they said among themselves , ' Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre ? ' <EOV> <SOV> And having looked , they see that the stone hath been rolled away -- for it was very great , <EOV> <SOV> and having entered into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right hand , arrayed in a long white robe , and they were amazed . <EOV> <SOV> And he saith to them , ' Be not amazed , ye seek Jesus the Nazarene , the crucified : he did rise -- he is not here ; lo , the place where they laid him ! <EOV> <SOV> and go , say to his disciples , and Peter , that he doth go before you to Galilee ; there ye shall see him , as he said to you . ' <EOV> <SOV> And , having come forth quickly , they fled from the sepulchre , and trembling and amazement had seized them , and to no one said they anything , for they were afraid . <EOV> <SOV> And he , having risen in the morning of the first of the sabbaths , did appear first to Mary the Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven demons ; <EOV> <SOV> she having gone , told those who had been with him , mourning and weeping ; <EOV> <SOV> and they , having heard that he is alive , and was seen by her , did not believe . <EOV> <SOV> And after these things , to two of them , as they are going into a field , walking , he was manifested in another form , <EOV> <SOV> and they having gone , told to the rest ; not even them did they believe . <EOV> <SOV> Afterwards , as they are reclining ( at meat ) , he was manifested to the eleven , and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart , because they believed not those having seen him being raised ; <EOV> <SOV> and he said to them , ' Having gone to all the world , proclaim the good news to all the creation ; <EOV> <SOV> he who hath believed , and hath been baptized , shall be saved ; and he who hath not believed , shall be condemned . <EOV> <SOV> ' And signs shall accompany those believing these things ; in my name demons they shall cast out ; with new tongues they shall speak ; <EOV> <SOV> serpents they shall take up ; and if any deadly thing they may drink , it shall not hurt them ; on the ailing they shall lay hands , and they shall be well . ' <EOV> <SOV> The Lord , then , indeed , after speaking to them , was received up to the heaven , and sat on the right hand of God ; <EOV> <SOV> and they , having gone forth , did preach everywhere , the Lord working with ' them ' , and confirming the word , through the signs following . Amen . <EOV> <EOC>
